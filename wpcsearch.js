This is even more so in heavy oil, which until recently was a domain strictly reserved to thermal recovery methods. This is no longer true following the success of a polymer flooding pilot in viscous oil in Canada. The Pelican Lake field in Canada, a giant with 6.4 billion barrels of oil in place, contains a 12-14 API oil with a viscosity that varies between 800 and 80,000 cp at reservoir conditions. In spite of this high viscosity, a polymer flood pilot was undertaken under secondary conditions and proved very successful with the oil rate climbing from 43 bopd to over 700 bopd while the water-cut remains below 60%. Following the results of the pilot, the flood has now being extended to most of the field. With several hundreds of polymer injection wells in operation, this development is the second largest chemical flood in the world after Daqing and the largest in heavy oil. This paper will describe the history of the field, the implementation of the successful polymer flood pilot and then will focus on the specific challenges of the full field extension, including dealing with higher viscosity oil and various sources of water including produced water.', 'BP has developed a range of innovative techniques to maximize economic oil recovery from its global miscible gas floods. The results have been reported in a series of publications over the past three decades. While some of these gas floods have been applied early in field life in secondary mode, in other cases gas flooding has been successfully initiated in mature, water-flooded fields. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of BP’s experience of establishing, managing and optimizing miscible gas floods. Prudhoe Bay (Alaska) is the world’s largest miscible gas project. Conventional and unconventional methods have been applied in a variety of different settings. An extensive surveillance program has facilitated a good understanding of the processes operating at field scale and surveillance data are used to optimize the flood. In 2000, a large-scale gas cap water injection project was implemented to slow the decline in field pressure. This project has made the vaporization process more efficient at higher pressure, resulting in additional recovery. Miscible gas injection has been extended to numerous other fields on the North Slope of Alaska. BP has two active miscible gas projects in the North Sea: Magnus and Ula. Tertiary miscible water-alternating-gas (WAG) flooding in Magnus field started in 2002 and its impact on reservoir performance is significant and well understood. Tertiary miscible WAG injection in Ula field started in 1998 and has played a key role in arresting production decline. The WAG scheme in Ula is currently being expanded. In addition to these projects, BP operates a CO 2 injection and storage project at In Salah, Algeria, where more than 3.2 million tonnes of CO 2 have been stored since 2004. Miscible gas injection has generated considerable benefits for BP over the past three decades and will continue to do so. The potential availability of large sources of CO 2 in the future, supplied by carbon capture, could help maintain a leading role for miscible gas injection for years to come.', 'Due to tight matrixes and developed fractures of low permeability reservoirs, it is difficult to carry out water flooding. CO 2 flooding that owns better injectivity and displacement effect becomes one of the most effective EOR methods for low permeability reservoirs. However, there is a big difference for CO 2 flooding between low permeability reservoirs and higher permeability reservoirs, which implies the limitations of conventional theories for CO 2 flooding in higher permeability reservoirs. In view of large pressure differential and uneven pressure distribution between injection well and production well in CO 2 flooding for low permeability reservoirs, three parameters of the miscible volumetric factor, the near-miscible volumetric factor and the immiscible volumetric factor were defined to characterize miscible extent in CO 2 flooding. Due to the diffusion effects in CO 2 flooding, there are two fronts of CO 2 flow, which are the gas phase front and the gas compositional front. Two concepts of the phase sweep coefficient and the compositional sweep coefficient were proposed to describe the displacement front of CO 2 flooding. Following this, the influence factors of the miscible volumetric factor and the compositional sweep coefficient in CO 2 flooding for low permeability reservoirs were obtained through reservoir simulation. The theories of CO 2 flooding that are suitable for low permeability reservoirs in continental deposit were formed on the basis of the miscible volumetric factor and the compositional sweep coefficient. Furthermore, the theories were applied in low permeability or extra-low permeability reservoirs of SINOPEC, which can reasonably illustrate displacement characteristics of CO 2 flooding for low permeability reservoirs. Currently, the pilot tests of CO 2 flooding have been going into effect, which indicates good prospects.', 'Digital Field technology has become the standard for green field development in the industry and brown fields are only in the progress toward it. OAO TATNEFT started an intelligent automation pilot on the 3 block of Berezovskoe field in November 2009. It is a marginal field and has been under development since 1962. At start of the project overriding objectives were to stimulate production and reduce OPEX. For this purpose in the scope of the project were included: - tracers injection and reservoir simulation; - pressure transient analysis of data from permanent downhole gauges; - automation of production wells and crosswell water injection system; - intrawell water separation; - renewable energy usage for injection well control equipment. Intelligent automation of mature field development process allowed to achieve following results: - exploration rate of field was maintained on the same level; - number of current workovers were reduced by 54 %; - formation pressure was increased by 4,9 % and watercut decreased by 4,3 % with an injection rate maintained on the same level. The case study in this paper addresses results of 3 years experiment, challenges we faced with and distinguishing features of brown field intelligent automation strategy.', 'Thermal-steam stimulation is considered as the most effective among up-to-date methods used for heavy oil production. However, the problem consists in lower coverage by steam injection and decreased efficiency of thermal-steam stimulation at a later stage of the development. The paper presents the results of solving this problem by combining thermal-steam and physicochemical stimulations using thermotropic gel-forming and oil-displacing systems: gels increase reservoir coverage by steam injection, while oil-displacing systems provide the increase in oil displacement factor. Such an approach implements the concept of using reservoir energy or that of the injected heat carrier to generate in situ intelligent chemical systems: gels, sols, surfactant and alkaline buffer solutions preserving and self-regulating in the reservoir for a long time a complex of properties optimal for oil displacement. Presented are the results of pilot tests and commercial use of the integrated technologies, combining thermal-steam and physicochemical stimulations, in oilfields of heavy oils in Russia and China. The application of the thermotropic gels GALKA ® , METKA ® and oil-displacing NINKA ® systems at area stimulation increased reservoir coverage by steam injection, decreased water cuttings of the production wells by 3-45%, increased oil production rate by 11-40% and decreased flow rate 14-25%. At cyclic-steam stimulation the increase in oil production rate ranged from 3 to 24 tons a day per well. The integrated technology of alternating injections of steam, thermotropic gel and oil-displacing systems was shown to be promising. In 2008-2011 after the injection of GALKA ® -C and NINKA ® systems into 41 injection wells in Usinskoye oilfield oil production rate increased by 4-30 tons/day and water cut decreased by 5-20%. The systems are commercially manufactured in Russia and China. The results of the works demonstrate synergism of thermal-steam and physicochemical stimulations of reservoirs and their combined application is promising to enhance heavy oil recovery.', 'Stock depletion is one of the major worldwide problems faced by the oil industry. Looking for new opportunities for oil extraction, companies constantly pursue new fields. At the same time, the recovery coefficient of existing stocks in many countries, including Russia, constitutes less than 30%. Meanwhile, this coefficient in developed countries is 65-70%, which is explained by the application of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods. Driven by this situation, several Russian companies have begun applying these methods and, consequently, have built up a great deal of useful experience. In this outstanding paper, which draws upon her extensive experience in the Oil & Gas industry, Elena Lazko, Deloitte&#39;s CIS Oil & Gas Leader, talks about the following topics: · experience of Russian companies in applying EOR methods; · factors hampering the application of EOR methods. All EOR methods applied by Russian companies can be classified into four categories: heat, gas, chemical and hydrodynamic methods. For various reasons, which are explored in the paper, some methods are more popular among companies than others. In order to present a background of companies’ experience of applying EOR methods at oilfields with oil and reservoirs showing different characteristics, a summary of classifications of Russian oil fields is provided. Despite the high efficiency of EOR methods, their application in Russia is not very widespread. To explain the reasons for this, an analysis of the major factors that hamper the spread of EOR methods in Russia has been performed. Furthermore, this study analyses the influence of factors such as government regulation, the investment climate and the corporate ownership structure on the development prospects of EOR methods in Russia.', 'Corefloods and field investigations confirm that Double Displacement Process (DDP) and Second Contact Water Displacement (SCWD) get higher oil recovery compared to WAG flooding in dipping reservoirs and flat thick reservoirs. Based on the production performance of the DDP and SCMD, two factors play a very important role in achieving high recovery efficiencies, they are injection production ratio and injection well position of geologic strike. Five experiments were designed to study the effect of injection rate and injection position the efficency of oil recovery and residual oil saturation during DDP, SCWD process in a group sandstone cores with light oil, at two injection rate and three positions. Saline water and nitrogen gas were used in long core flooding test under reference condition: it means 50 ? and 10Mpa. Results showed that the lower gas injection rate (0.05ml/min) leaded more stable gas-oil contact to reach higher recovery efficiencies, compared to the higher injection rate(0.1ml/min). Research has revealed that the injection location of structure was a remarkable effect on displacement efficiency, the bottom water flooding and the above gas flooding could get the better oil recovery. It is worthwhile to note that the value of oil recovery efficency for 5°dip and 10°dip test are so close after SCMD, the increamental oil recovery than the first water flooding by 19 % and 20.2% , respectively.\xa0', 'This paper provides a compelling review about the world’s largest nitrogen IOR project in the giant field Cantarell, an oil field offshore GOM. Cantarell is Mexico’s largest resource being operated by Pemex. The very successful IOR project includes the daily injection of 1.5 bn scf per day (50.000 tons) of nitrogen for pressure maintenance since year 2000. The basic reservoir characteristic and production history will be presented, including the very positive field response of more than doubling the oil production from 1 million bblpd to 2.2.million bblpd. Alternative EOR technologies are techno-commercially assessed. The supply of these demanded gigantic nitrogen volumes by an air separation plant and the associated infrastructure will be explained in detail. Additionally we intend to provide limited insight into the second largest EGR (Enhanced Gas Recovery) project in the Habshan field in the United Emirates being operated by ADNOC. Here 600 mill scf per day (20.000 tons) are injected into a condensate reservoir for pressure maintenance. These nitrogen volumes have substituted the previous natural gas injection, making the high value NG available for sales. The conclusion is that Nitrogen IOR/EOR is state of the art technology with proven applicability in both on- and offshore fields, in both oil and condensate fields.', 'Chemical flooding research and application endeavors have been addressed in carbonate reservoirs much less than in sandstone reservoirs, although over 60% of the hydrocarbon reserves are held in carbonate reservoirs. Carbonate reservoirs are usually characterized as low permeability matrix with fractures, while a considerable portion present high permeability matrix with fractures as shown in the Middle East. This paper presents the challenges of chemical EOR in a representative Middle East carbonate reservoir, which shows high reservoir temperature and high brine salinity. The roadmap has been set up to develop chemical EOR technologies from laboratory research towards pilot test. This paper provides an overview of the chemical EOR research for the carbonate reservoir and presents laboratory and simulation research results to show the insights of oil recovery from this kind of reservoir rather than sandstone reservoirs.\xa0', 'Production of huge or mature oil field brings numerous operational challenges that may require a combination of generic proven solutions with specifically thinkable brains and effective ideas. This paper outlines a general understanding of field performance monitoring and optimization system. Its principle aim is to systematically monitor any change or fluctuation from expected production behavior, and consequently infer the most likely reasons of this fluctuation; as well as recommendations on possible actions to solve and manage all kind of problems. The field optimization system passes through a creation of an integrated model enabling optimization and assessment of field production, identifying bottlenecks in the system and consequently opportunities to increase oil production. Field management is challenging due to daily production fluctuations related to many problems such as pressure maintenance, gas and water breakthrough; and flow assurance issues. Each area in the field is characterized by its specific problems. An increase of production with about 17% (6500 B/D) was assessed after a successful monitoring and optimized corrective action plan in one area of the field which covers about 100 wells, where many wells have a severe salt deposit problem, other wells suffering with asphaltin problems and a group of gas lift wells need continuous surveillance and monitoring to reduce production downtime. This result was highly appreciated and leads to generalize the work for others 20 areas of the field (1000 wells). The greatest benefit provided by this work is a significant improvement of understanding of an integrated production system, set an approach for real time monitoring and optimization which improve timely decision making on right action taken and describe a strategy to build a strong multidisciplinary team, with a high level sense of analysis and problem solving; this will help for better monitor and manage the field, and consequently enhance production.', 'A sustained growth of world energy needs and a decline of numerous mature fields are expected in the years to come. That situation represents a challenge that can be taken up, but with a higher contribution of advanced Oil & Gas Exploration and Production technologies, at least during the short/mid term period of the energetic transition era. Among various ways to extend oil fields production, chemical EOR processes have been subject of renewed interest in the recent years. However, the technical and economical risks involved in the implementation of a chemical EOR process in a mature field require careful assessment and design, through combined laboratory and multi-scale simulation studies. The present paper deals with the contribution of EOR simulation models that must firstly integrate the essential physics of chemical EOR, then be properly calibrated from experimental data, before undertaking pilot- and reservoir-scale simulations. Advanced models of essential chemical phenomena & processes will be presented, including description of the underlying physics and practical methodology of implementation/calibration with industrial simulation software. These models concern for instance, methods to reduce surfactant consumption, foam-based mobility control processes, and chemical restoration of a water wettability in naturally-oil-wet media, a process that may be decisive for fractured carbonate reservoirs. Illustrations of such newly-developed modeling capabilities will be shown both at the core scale from the simulation of specific and original EOR laboratory experiments, and at the field scale on typical cross-sections of reservoirs with unfavorable recovery diagnosis.', 'Waterflooding is one of the earliest methods used successfully for recovery of oil from petroleum reservoirs. The Smart Water injection is based on experimental observations that variation of the injected water salinity and of its ion balance may result in additional oil recovery. High salinity waterflooding (with potential determining ions Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ and SO 4 2- ) in high temperature chalk reservoirs and low salinity water flooding in sandstone reservoirs are two characteristic examples. In this work the equipment for measuring the effect of Smart Water is being conceived, designed, tested and implemented. Injection strategy can be controlled through advanced custom made software. Independent axial and sleeve pressures are applied to simulate real-life stresses at reservoir conditions. The hydraulic pressure can be maintained up to 700 bar at 150°C. Core holder parts (inlet and outlet) have been fitted with devices for measuring sound velocity and electrical resistivity. Produced oil fractions were determined by scintillation. In an initial series of experiments outcrop chalk (Stevns Klint) samples were used. In order to accurately determine additional oil recovery by Smart Water injection the used reservoirs oils were saturated with 14 C labeled crude oil. A screening study of ions related to typical formation water values carried out to determine their effect on oil recovery. It is concluded that higher aging time reduces the primary and ultimate oil recovery obtained using seawater with added SO 4 2- anions. Furthermore, 10 times diluted seawater can be used as tertiary injection brine for improving oil recovery after seawater has been used as secondary injection fluid. For the Smart Waters considered in this work, crude oil/brine interactions were studied utilizing interfacial measurements. Contact angle measurements on calcite surface were carried out to correlate wettability alterations.', 'The novel biopolymer Schizophyllan has been found to exhibit unique properties that make it an ideal candidate as viscosifier for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) with clear upsides in comparison to commercial available polymers. Following intensive research by Wintershall Holding GmbH and BASF SE, a first pilot field trial was designed and polymer injection started end of 2012. Schizophyllan’s unique properties include tolerance against high temperature, salinity and shear, as well as high viscosifying efficiency, low adsorption and low environmental impact. It is therefore significantly extending the application envelope for polymer flooding to areas where polymer flooding could not be applied so far, i.e. to temperatures up to 130°C and arbitrary salt contents. For the field trial, an existing biotechnology plant at BASF’s industrial compound at Ludwigshafen, Germany, has being expanded to include a pilot plant for the production of a sufficient amount of Schizophyllan. The Schizophyllan is then being injected into a mature oil field in Northern Germany. New wells were drilled in the selected project area and surface facilities for polymer storage and mixing and oil transportation were constructed. The presentation describes the characteristics of the novel biopolymer, summarizes learnings from the implementation phase and provides current results of the biopolymer field trial. The surveillance plan will be discussed, and the challenges posed by planning and executing a new technology trial in a mature oil field are highlighted.', '', '', '', 'Exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources in the offshore Russian Arctic are challenged by a harsh environment including the presence of ice, pack ice, icebergs, permafrost, low temperatures, and extended periods of darkness. Remoteness, accessibility, logistics, and limited infrastructure make activities in the Russian Arctic even more challenging. In some areas, the ice-free season can be long enough to allow use of conventional offshore drilling rigs with ice defense systems for exploration drilling. However, in many areas, the ice-free season is so short that exploration drilling from either a bottom-founded or floating drilling system, combined with the appropriate ice management support systems, will be needed to enable drilling in seasonal ice. Depending on whether the discovery is in shallow or deepwater, an arctic bottom founded structure or an arctic floating drilling system will be utilized to conduct drilling with a target of year-round operability. Similarly, the ultimate selection of the production concept will also be driven by water depth, as well as several other design factors. Remote subsea technology will be an enabler for continuous production under the ice in deepwater. A combination of advanced technologies, in conjunction with flawless execution, is required to successfully capture Russian Arctic oil and gas resources safely and economically. This paper will illustrate the required integration across a suite of technologies to enable safe and reliable operations in support of Russian Arctic exploration, development and production. Technical advancements and ongoing research will also be highlighted with a focus on the importance of conducting and incorporated learnings from Russian Arctic field programs.', 'A large part of the Norwegian shelf lies within the area known as the Arctic. This applies both to parts of the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. This presentation focuses on the Barents Sea. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) believes that nearly half of the undiscovered resources on the Norwegian shelf are found in the Barents Sea. Only the southernmost part of the Barents Sea has been opened for petroleum activity. Around 100 exploration wells have been drilled in the Barents Sea since the area was opened for petroleum activity in 1980. Many discoveries have been made; however, only one field has started production so far – the Snøhvit gas field operated by Statoil. The field is developed with a subsea solution and the wellstream is transported through a 160-kilometer long pipeline to an LNG facility on land. Another field is under development, the Goliat oil field, with planned production start-up in late 2014. This field is being developed with a circular FPSOENI is the operator of Goliat. Interest in exploring in the Barents Sea has risen sharply since three major discoveries were made in 2011/2012, two oil discoveries and a gas discovery. This successful exploration has continued in autumn 2013. The demarcation line agreement between Norway and Russia was ratified in the summer of 2011. This agreement meant new ocean territory in the Barents Sea for Norway. The NPD has mapped potential petroleum resources in the new area, and the data is available for purchase. The new area in the Barents Sea South was opened for petroleum activity by the Norwegian Parliament in the summer of 2013. This presentation is intended to provide an updated picture of resource opportunities and challenges associated with petroleum activity in the Norwegian part of the Barents Sea.', 'The paper provides information on the current state and prospects of oil and gas resources development in the major offshore oil and gas basins of the World, including the Arctic. The most important achievements and negative results of offshore oil and gas industry in the last decade are considered. The main trends of the offshore oil and gas production volume in the Arctic and the World Ocean in comparison with trends of the unconventional hydrocarbons production are illustrated. It is shown that Russia is the leader in terms of hydrocarbons production, both the Arctic onshore and offshore. The paper also provides information on the geological and geophysical study density of the Arctic offshore and the current state of the geophysical and drilling fleets of Russia. The analyses of the petrophysical and thermobaric conditions studies at big depths are presented. A great role of abnormally high reservoir pressures (AHRP) for preserving industrial reservoirs, which significantly increases the hydrocarbon resources of the Arctic region, is shown. It is proved that Russia is the leader in the Arctic hydrocarbon reserves and resources. Advices on selecting priority projects for the development on the Arctic offshore are given. Particular attention is paid to natural and man-made problems of the offshore oil and gas resources development, including AHRP, permafrost, gas pockets and gas hydrates. It is shown that the offshore of five countries in the Arctic region is not enough studied to start a large-scale oil and gas fields development. The best results of the Arctic oil and gas resources studies and developments with the preservation of its ecosystem can be achieved only through international cooperation.', 'Oil companies must be prepared to work in the Arctic environment and face among others, challenges related to darkness, ice, remoteness, lack of infrastructure and vulnerable environments. This paper describes a new R&D programme, that Eni E&P, in collaboration with Eni Norge, is developing for the Barents Sea. The programme will focus on safety, working environment, social, environmental and oil spill preparedness issues. The aim of this initiative is to increase Eni’s preparedness to operate safely in Arctic environments. The paper will focus on social and environmental issues, illustrating the activities that, in the framework of this programme, will be developed to address these challenges. With regard to the social aspects, the paper summarizes the strategy developed to support a process of sustainable development responding to the local community needs and respecting the rights of indigenous people living in the Arctic areas. With regard to the environmental aspects, the paper illustrates the Arctic oil spill response strategies and equipment that can be used to minimise the risk of potential impacts of oil on the marine ecosystem. An accurate impact evaluation of the programme is not feasible yet, because it is still in a development phase. In spite of this, it is possible to foresee that this programme will improve Eni competitiveness in future bid rounds and demonstrate to relevant stakeholders that the company owns the necessary knowledge and preparedness for operation in the Arctic . Finally, the programme is an opportunity for increased collaboration and expertise/knowledge sharing between the eni subsidiaries.', 'Huge Methane Hydrates (HM) reserves are expected to be unconventional natural gas resources reserved in Arctic area. However their developments are economically difficult, because dissociation heat is limited and gas transportation is costly in the area. In this study, the “Gas-To-Wire” system has been proposed to provide economical gas production system from MH layers. The system is an integrated gas production system that generates electricity using produced gas from MH reserves and sends it to onshore. Its advantage is that hot water for dissociating MH can be served from waste heat of the gas turbine electric generating system (about 60% of total combustion heat) without using additional energy. In the integrated system, generated hot water is circulated to produce gas continuously. The gas production rate reached the maximum peak just after breakthrough of injected water between horizontal wells, then it declined and gas was produced at an almost constant rate. We have successfully developed the numerical model, and matched the history of physical gas production. Moreover, numerical simulations of gas production by the hot water injection into a Nankai Trough sediment layer model using a pair of the horizontal wells 500m in length, were carried out for a methane hydrate reservoir of 20 m in layer thickness, 46% of average methane hydrate saturation, 100 and 25 md in horizontal and vertical absolute permeabilities, respectively. The cumulative gas production is simulated as 5×10 6 std-m 3 for an initial two years. Furthermore, a new gas production scheme, which uses four horizontal wells in radian arrangement in a methane hydrate sediment layer with area of 1km×1km located at Nankai Trough, has been presented and evaluated with the numerical simulation as the cumulative gas production for 15 years is 1.3×10 8 std-m 3 .', 'Reserves of gas in the Arctic are anticipated to be up to 1000 TCF (28,000 Gm 3 ), and are likely to play a significant role in future energy plans. Considering the importance of these resources, TOTAL has a focused programme of Arctic research activities on gas field development. However, proposing a development scheme that may be economically viable, provide high safety levels in the harsh conditions; and attuned to the particular environmental conditions, presents many challenges. For these reasons, an active research and development program is ongoing to develop new solutions and technologies. This paper presents the research topics which Total is currently undertaking and outlines proposed new solutions to meet the challenging demands. The solutions cover a range of topics from exploration to operation, including HSE. The paper outlines aspects of ultra-extended reach drilling during exploration stage, where the objective is to achieve a whole-well delivery solution to be able to reach far beyond the current record of 12.374 km total measured depth. Another aspect introduced in the paper is the design of surface facilities in extreme cold regions, and the recurrent issue of what type of enclosure should be selected. An innovative solution, offering the best compromise between CAPEX, operability and safety, has been investigated, and the results of this are presented and discussed. In addition, the paper also explores the issues concerning export of gas, and focuses on recent developments of shipping solutions for LNG export. HSE issues are highly sensitive in the Arctic and raise new challenges, and is the final aspect covered. In addition to join with other operators to provide joint solutions on response technologies and on common standards, the paper outlines a dedicated solution using bio-sensors for environmental monitoring.', 'Despite the significant developments in recent years in numerical modelling of the ice gouging process, it still remains a challenge to incorporate the effects of different contributing factors in the numerical model. Further work is required to correctly predict the numerical inputs in the model to obtain meaningful results. With increasing development of rarely explored arctic and sub-arctic fields, and increasing demand to install subsea pipelines in the region, it has become even more necessary to increase our confidence in numerical model outputs. Technip, in collaboration with University of Aberdeen, has undertaken a project to develop a fully calibrated numerical model validated by physical test modelling. The validated numerical model is aimed at estimating a realistic prediction of the seabed deformation behaviour and a realistic assessment of extent of unacceptable strains in the pipeline below the seabed thereby providing more confidence in estimating the safe burial depth at which a pipeline could be laid in those regions. The experimental part of the study was undertaken at the University of Aberdeen where two different sand channels were used for testing scaled iceberg models of different shapes (defined by different angles of the frontal side of the models). Tests were undertaken in both loose and dense sand. Numerical simulations were undertaken by Technip using CEL (Coupled Eulerian - Langrangian) numerical formulation in FE software package ABAQUS. The study presented is being undertaken in three phases where each phase [ai1] is characterised by a set of physical tests modelling ice gouging under laboratory conditions followed by numerical simulations. Here we report on the first two phases of the study. Phase 1 – aimed at understanding the sensitivity of the iceberg shape and iceberg gouging depth on the measured drag force. In addition, validation of the numerical model was successfully achieved in this stage where the numerical results, in terms of drag force, were compared with experimental results. Phase 2 – a detailed experimental study using a larger and more robust channel where the influence of relative density of sand on the drag force and sub gouge deformation has been examined using load cell and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) method respectively. The results from the experimental study have been used to calibrate the subsequent numerical model. Phase 3 – an on-going experimental study using a scaled model of a rigid pipeline placed at various depths within the sub-gouged zone to establish the relationship between the strains in the soil to those in the pipeline. These results will be used to complete calibration of the numerical model for pipeline strain predictions.', 'A dear child comes with many names: digital oilfield, smart fields, integrated operations, i-field and more. The technology and services in this area have progressed from addressing individual problems in the course of production to becoming the way that the exploration and production of oil and gas is done. This means that instead of looking at this technology only in cases where the well or facility is underperforming or having special challenges, integrated operations is incorporated into the development of the well or entire facility as a de-facto standard. Fairly small technological adaptations and operational changes can generate huge profit. High performing organizations have developed their work processes and skill sets to embrace the advances in collaborative solutions, operational flexibility and form networked organization. If you want to perform a lean operation in remote areas, such as the high north, away from populations, whilst maintaining a good understanding of the nature of the well and production facilities with active monitoring and good contingency planning, integrated operations are the way forward. In the Arctic, you cannot go into the ice to replace a failing turbine or any other piece of heavy machinery. Smaller elements can be flown in with helicopter, but heavy equipment cannot be delivered in the winter. If there is a failure and resultant spill in this environment there is no known technology for recovering oil under the ice. The only way that safe operation of wells in the Arctic will be made possible is through digital oilfield solutions.', 'The last decade has seen an unprecedented and continuously growing interest to explore offshore Arctic. Major international energy companies are now mobilizing their resources, improving competence and knowledge, developing technology and internal regulations to prepare for a long lasting and challenging journey. This paper is intended to provide a review and comparison of the most stringent international standards and regulations relevant for the Arctic region including but not limited to as follows: American Petroleum Institute (API)International Organization for Standardization (ISO)U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (U.S. CFR)Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE)UK Health and Safety Executive (UK HSE)Norsk Sokkels Konkurranseposisjon (NORSOK)Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA)Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD)Federal Agency on Technical Regulation and Metrology (Rosstandart) · Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Supervision (Rostekhnadzor) Each entity has its strong sides that are usually based on previous industry experience and accidents resulting in substantial downtime, harm to environment, equipment and not least the personnel. At the same time simultaneous compliance to divergent standards might compromise overall safety. Bearing in mind extreme environmental sensitivity of the Arctic region, scale of impact and possible environmental consequences, there is literally no room for failure. Differences in safety philosophy and approach to well barrier elements to ensure well control and well integrity need to be thoroughly reviewed. Understanding these issues will improve safety in well construction, reduce cost of the exploration and mitigate potential operational and project risks.', 'Large energy needs, the majority of which are from oil and gas, depletion of reserves in onshore fields, discovery of new and perspective deposits on the Arctic and the far Eastern shelf of Russia, promotes the production of oil and gas offshore in ice seas. Development of offshore oil and gas fields is accompanied now and in the future by accidents with spills of liquid hydrocarbons. Other things being equal, the probability of a crash in ice seas is higher due to the considerably more severe environmental conditions. The presence of ice plays an important role in the propagation of oil spills and its further evolution. Analysis of various methods of oil spill response in ice seas showed the highest efficiency of the methods of burning oil spill and mechanical methods. An important role in oil spill response belongs to the equipment of the operation of all kinds of special technical means: remote detection of oil in sea ice conditions, tracking and movement of the oil spill, delivery of the equipment and personnel to the spill and other factors It is necessary to create special regional organizations, which are responsible for the preparation and holding of oil spill response. They must be not just headquarters, which on paper form action plans (although this work is very important), but it should be an effective organization with all the necessary means and human resources. For this, of course, a corresponding status of these organizations and presence of a special Fund is necessary, which allows in the shortest terms, to intensify action. It is obvious that without the support of oil companies and governments (and regional authorities), such organizations with this status and such mobility would be impossible to create.', 'In this paper the problem of evaluating the minimum volume of hydrocarbon resources in a prospect, for its profitable development is considered. It involves evaluation on the basis of technical and economical criteria of a threshold, such that future development of a prospect is considered profitable if the prospect is expected to contain a volume of hydrocarbons equal or higher than the threshold value. Development conditions on the Russian Arctic Shelf are taken into account including specific challenges on cost estimation: shortage of comparable analogs and Russian Arctic project costs uncertainty. In this paper an approach to determine the resource threshold is proposed. Net present value is used as a basic economic criterion and modeled as a mathematical problem including different parameters depending on the hydrocarbon volume, or fixed for considered development plan. A flexible solution of the problem is performed in Maple software with a possibility to change input parameters including forecasted production profile parameters and estimated cost dependencies. Given the minimum target NPV value, an inverse problem of evaluating the minimum hydrocarbon volume is solved numerically. Calculations are performed in the oil equivalent units respecting the uncertainty at the exploration stage on finding oil or gas resources or their combination and different economic values of the hydrocarbons. Quantitative uncertainty on hydrocarbon resource volume is represented by an interval, fuzzy number or probability distribution obtained as a result of uncertainty analysis for expected geological parameters. Determination of such quantitative uncertainties for different prospects and resource thresholds estimated with the flexible solution proposed, comparison of these obtained parameters and the following quantitative risk assessment allows performing initial screening of prospects in the region, their ranking and making decisions more effectively for the exploration and development planning in the undeveloped Arctic prospective areas comprising at the moment high level uncertainties.', 'This paper explores the dynamics of risk management in the context of specific recent experiences in deep and ultra-deep water exploration and production. Now that shallow-water developments are more mature, operators are looking toward new offshore areas to further develop their oil and gas portfolios. Although target areas can vary these developments have in common a large degree of technical innovation in combination with new risks, to realize these projects. It is crucial to identify and understand the risks related to any offshore oil and gas operation and particularly when moving into more challenging environments with more remote locations, increasingly challenging reservoirs, harsher environments and more environmentally sensitive areas. The risks will be site, operation and time specific and it is important to maintain a holistic view of risk through a lifetime perspective to manage these in an acceptable way. New geographical areas for oil and gas development may not have the benefit of well-developed regulatory regimes to guide risk-based approaches. In addition, safety and environmental performance cannot be assured through technical solutions alone. Safe operations are also dependent on effective organizations, strong managements and motivated competent people. This paper notes the overall challenges of the exploration and production business in ensuring safety and reliability, and highlights the opportunities and dangers of recent business growth. Risks are organized by theme, with focuses on regulation, safety and environmental impact, technology and innovation, cost and time, competence and quality, and harsh climates. The authors draw on the experience gained over more than 30 years from oil & gas frontiers such the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Offshore Brazil, Offshore West Africa and Offshore Western Australia. Developers and other stakeholders are encouraged to draw lessons from these experiences when attempting to model the interplay of regulatory, commercial and technical factors in project developments.', 'Modern oil exploration activities in conventional reservoir fields are becoming very focused on ultra-deep offshore prospects, which prove to be extremely challenging in many ways. Beyond the success of a first hydrocarbon discovery, a tangled list of complex issues, both technical and economic, has to be tackled by the multidisciplinary project team. On top of that, the oil companies’ unrelenting chase after new resources is pushing technical teams towards a new kind of approach, often called “fast track” project, which has become more and more common in the last decade of oil and gas business. The matter is now not only whether the oil is there and can be produced in an economic way, but most importantly the key question is how much the first oil and the recovery can be accelerated in a safer and reliable manner. This paper aims to describe the issue from the subsurface standpoint, describing what are the pros and cons of such an approach. Particular attention is given to common problems and pitfalls that reservoir geologists and engineers must face during the definition of the optimal field development scenario. The latter represents the solid foundation of all drilling, operation and facilities engineering studies plus, of course, project economic evaluations. The conventional roadmap to project execution acknowledged in the industry for many years is strongly challenged by fast track projects. A major factor is the drastic reduction of appraisal drilling phase that normally comes before field development plan definition. This phase is somehow incorporated in the “near field exploration” campaign running in parallel to technical studies, hence requiring extra flexibility in many project decisions. A real case study in offshore West Africa is presented, including a practical guideline of team interactions and recommendations that may be useful for similar applications.', 'In the last decades, many discoveries and field developments have been made in deep-water plays around the globe. Important lessons learned in more mature areas like the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico - have been applied to more recent ventures worldwide. This presentation highlights technical learnings that supported success in these plays and application opportunities in Russia. In West Africa, over 22 billion oil-equivalent barrels were discovered in deep-water reservoirs in less than 15 years. Exploration success was due to the presence of robust petroleum systems, high quality reservoirs and efficient technology development and application. Congo Basin and Niger Delta deep-water play areas were identified as active, oil-prone hydrocarbon systems and reservoir-prone long before any discoveries were made; under-scoring the importance of regional analysis. In these basins, companies entering the correct areas early captured most of the value. Exploration success rates were highest where 3D seismic was used and hydrocarbons could be directly detected. Many deep-water exploration discoveries have significant reservoir and trap complexity. With long construction lead times and high costs, early and accurate subsurface models are needed to guide profitable deep-water development. Subsurface characterizations leveraging high-quality 3D seismic more accurately predict reservoir and seal architecture. Fundamental understanding of deep-water depositional processes is a key enabler and is supported by an active research program. Later in production life, 4D (time-lapse) seismic, integrated with field surveillance data and history-matched reservoir models have been instrumental in identifying un-swept hydrocarbons and in-fill or re-development opportunities, resulting in increased hydrocarbon recovery. In Russia, Sakhalin Island and the Black Sea are areas with established and emerging deep-water exploration and development opportunities. Application of key learnings from a broad global experience base will aid exploration and help ensure profitable deep-water developments.', 'Santos Basin Pre-Salt Cluster, Deepwater Southeast Brazil, is a unique scenario due to the heterogeneous nature of its microbial carbonate reservoir, underlain by a 2000 m salt layer and a distance of 300 km from the coast. Other characteristics for development were the variable CO 2 content and compositional grading in the reservoir fluids, flow assurance issues and special demands concerning subsea engineering, well construction and processing plant. Recognizing reservoir and development uncertainties, Petrobras and its partners have opted for a staged development, based on extended well tests (EWTs), multi well production pilots and definitive systems prioritizing the standardization of well projects and production systems. This strategy aims at both accelerated cash flow and dynamic characterization of the reservoir behavior, subsea gathering system and the processing of fluids in production units. Long term recovery was not forgotten as flexibility was planned for different recovery mechanism as water, gas and water alternating gas (WAG) injection. This paper presents an overview of the main drivers and concepts which served as the basis for the development of the prolific pre-salt fields. Pre-salt mega-projects management was early identified as especially challenging: it should assure that the main uncertainties were known and mitigated at project sanction, as well as pursuing strategies for CAPEX reduction, standardization, on-time long lead items delivery and local content accomplishment, among others. Integration of disciplines and the flexibility were paramount to achieve these goals. The first results are on stream: after only seven years from discovery, production reached more than 150,000 bopd, through six producers; water and gas injection systems are in operation. The lessons learned are being considered to optimize the next generation of platforms. The plans are to install two more FPSOs in 2014, and 8 more until 2016. An oil flow rate of more than 1 million bopd, operated by Petrobras, is expected for 2017.', 'The Aasta Hansteen development in the northern part of the Norwegian Sea represents the first step in opening a new and promising part of the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). The resource base for the development is three separate gas discoveries of late Cretaceous age. The water depth is 1300 meters, and Aasta Hansteen represents the deepest development so far on the NCS. The water depth and harsh weather conditions dictates a different development mindset than “standard” NCS solutions. Opening a new region requires a gas evacuation solution, and the Polarled Development Project (PDP) was initiated and runs in parallel with the Aasta Hansteen project. A new 480 kilometer 36” gas pipeline will extend from the Aasta Hansteen platform to the Nyhamna gas plant facility on the west coast of Mid Norway. Modifications to the gas plant are also a part of Polarled Development Project. The Aasta Hansteen gas bearing formations are deep marine turbidite sandstones in a large fan system in the basin. The gas is very dry and has low CO 2 and H 2 S content. The drainage strategy is depletion with seven gas production wells, drilled from three different subsea templates. The small amounts of condensate require a separate solution for storage and shipping. The platform is an FPSO of the spar type, the first of its kind on the NCS, the world largest and the first with condensate storage and offloading facilities. Opening a new area and building new infrastructure means catering for future tie-ins in the area. Spare area and weight capacity as well as spare riser slots and tie-in opportunities subsea will be provided. The gas pipeline will include possibilities for future tie-ins.', 'This paper provides a review of recent technology advancements and addresses practical considerations associated with drillpipe and drill stem components for extreme deepwater drilling applications. Ultra-high torque double-shoulder rotary connections are often employed in these applications. Recent developments and enchantments in these connection designs including new higher strength materials, advanced thread forms and associated improvements in torsional strength and fatigue performance are presented. Deepwater wells frequently require long, heavy casing strings to achieve the total depth objectives. High capacity landing strings capable of running these heavy strings with total hook loads approaching 2.5 million pounds have been successfully developed to address this well design challenge. The paper discusses the engineering solutions implemented to overcome the high forces, slip crushing concerns and material strength and toughness considerations for these critical applications. Due to the dramatic increase in oil prices the industry has seen a re-emergence of deep and ultra-deep drilling projects that encounter H 2 S gas. The paper provides an update on the latest sulphide stress cracking (SSC) resistant drillpipe grades including the first fully SSC resistant drill pipe system with SSC resistant friction welds joining the drill pipe tubes and tool joints. Major operators have been using a drill pipe based riser system for intervention and completion work in the waters offshore Brazil, Australia, Africa and other deepwater basins around the world. The paper provides updates on design improvements of high pressure capacity connectors and advanced materials for these critical riser applications. Deepwater wells often encounter abrasive formations, high side loads between the drill string and bore hole and other conditions that promote drill stem friction heating failures. The paper includes characteristic features of these failures along with case histories and prevention methods. \xa0', 'It is clear that deep water & ultra-deep water exploration becomes the global hot spot. Deep water becomes a practical reserves growth. Multi-stage investment and multi-stage payback mode have formed. There are 750 oilfields discovery and over 125 billion reserves discovered in the deep water area. Exploration and development history can be subdivided into 4 stages. Deep water exploration success, benefits from the continuous improvement of exploration and development technology. Exploration technology progress improves the success rate of exploration. Intelligent drilling and completion technology reduce costs. Various kinds of intelligent platforms and subsea production systems allow the development. Hydrocarbon enrichment in the deep water basins are characterized by developing of multiple sets of excellent source-reservoir-seal combination. These basins are divided into salt basins and non-salt basins according to the existence of salt or not. Source rocks with organic enrichment mainly developed in the stage of fault subsided and depression and are continental and transitional facies. Reservoirs are mainly delta-submarine fan sedimentary systems. Reservoir types include structural type, composite type and stratigraphic type, and the structural type is the main type. Hydrocarbon enrichment laws in the deep water shows that source rocks control oil and gas distribution area, facies control oil and gas rich belt and migration pathway controls horizontal position. There is large exploration potential in the Tethys petroleum domains of deep water basins in North Atlantic and Indian Ocean.', 'With the future of India&#39;s energy security lying in deep water, ensuring flow of well fluid from reservoir to reception facility assumes increasing importance. Flow assurance goals assure reliable and economic production by overcoming issues of complex reservoir characteristics, extreme external hydrostatic pressures, low ambient temperatures, long-distance tiebacks etc. With increasing water depth, system operability like hydraulic flow instability becomes an area of concern as multiphase fluid has to be transported from well bore to surface facilities. These concerns are normally associated with transient operations, which, if not properly managed, can lead to increased downtime and high remediation costs. Flow assurance impacts every phase of field development, affecting a production system&#39;s concept selection, design and operating strategy. No single flow assurance solution exists and a combination of prediction, prevention and remediation techniques are necessary to ensure unhindered production over the field life. Ultra-deep water discoveries in East coast like GS-29, G-4, G-1, S-1, and Vasishtha from PEL blocks and discoveries in KG-DWN-98/2 NELP block, which it plans to monetize in a record time through integrated East Coast hub. The first oil from project Manik is expected in 2011-12. Gas production is expected to start in 2011-12 and reach 37 MMSCMD by 2015-16. The gas fields are proposed for development from sub-sea to shore and oil fields by deploying FPSO. The paper discusses flow assurance challenges likely to be faced during development, in the form of paraffin/waxes/asphaltene from oil discoveries and hydrates from the deep sea gas discoveries. This paper focuses on flow assurance issues associated during development phases, their avoidance through design and their mitigation and management through operational strategies and procedures.', 'South America was separated from Africa during the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean in the Early Cretaceous period. Similar tectonic evolution led to the reasonable analogy in sedimentation and petroleum geology for both sides of the Passive Margins. Explorers discovered the Late Cretaceous turbidites plays in the deepwater area of Ghana (the Jubilee Field), and then they applied the same play concept to exploration in French Guiana, the counterpart in the Equatorial Transform Margins. Consequently, they discovered the giant Zaedyus Field. These discoveries opened a new page for the exploration of the Turbidites plays in these twin basins along the Equatorial Atlantic Margins. Turbidite systems developed along the slope provided the high-quality reservoirs, and turbidites bodies could provide perfect stratigraphic traps for oil and gas accumulation. Source rock was contributed by the distal organic-rich shale rocks of the same age. However, exploration for the Late Cretaceous Turbidite Plays was complicated. Wells drilled following the Zaedyus discovery in French Guiana were unsuccessful. One turbidite system may prove to contain commercial hydrocarbons, but the nearby ones could be disappointing in exploration. The reservoir was not the problem since 3 wells encountered thick sand layers; the main reason may lie in the difference of hydrocarbon migration into these isolated turbidite sand bodies. Furthermore seals and preservation of the accumulations may be a problem. Late Cretaceous turbidite play concept was applied to evaluate the exploration of Brazilian Equatorial Margin, especially for the Foz Do Amazon Basin, which is the nearest one to French Guiana. Tectonic and petroleum geology could be of high similarity, and the same problems of hydrocarbon migration, seals or preservation may also exist in the area. Different turbidite systems were developed, and the turbidites close to the source kitchen should be the potential ones with exploration priority.', 'The recent discovery of a new gas play in the deep part of the Levantine Basin, offshore Israel promotes growing international interest. Since 2009 seven gas fields were found in the southeastern Mediterranean Sea 50- 180 km west of the coastline, among these the multi TCF discoveries of Leviathan and Tamar. The total amount of recoverable gas resources found to date is estimated at 30 TCF. Gas was found in water depth ranging from 1400 to 1800m within series of deep marine turbidite sands at depth of 4500 to 5000 m below MSL. Drilling to this depth involve significant technological challenges that includes penetration through a 1-2 km thick Messinian salt layer. The sand layers display excellent reservoir properties, with net thickness of 50-150 meters and average porosity of 20-25%. They were transported from the exposed Afro-Arabian shelf in the south and southeast and were deposited in series of submarine channels and fans that extended throughout the Levantine basin in the late Oligocene to early Miocene. Geochemical characteristics indicate that the gas is biogenic. Its likely source is organic-rich layers found within the 3-6 km thick late Tertiary basin-fill. In the early part of 2013 production started from the Tamar field, the first deep-water gas discovery in the region. Extensive exploration and production activity is presently taking place offshore Israel and Cyprus to further develop this extremely successful world-class, deep-water gas play.', 'The deepwater Qiongdongnan Basin, northwestern South China Sea, was the frontier in China in last five years. There were 3D seismic data of 11000 square kilometers. Five deepwater wildcat wells were drilled with only one discovery. The petroleum system was analyzed and favorable prospects were evaluated. The Qiongdongnan Basin underwent the Paleogene syn-rift episode and the Neogene post-rift episode. Most deepwater wells penetrated the lower Oligocene to Quaternary and indicated the early bathyal environment in Late Oligocene. Integrated with the regional 3D seismic interpretation, drilling results, and geological studies, petroleum system developed in the deepwater Basin. The primary elements of petroleum system were source rocks, reservoirs, and hydrocarbon migration. The source rocks were coast plain mudstones of the lower Oligocene, which were coaly, rich in TOC and gas-prone. Upper Miocene turbidite sandstones developed generally in the Central Canyon with thick sandstones and good porosity and permeability. The lower Miocene and Upper Oligocene submarine fans developed in several subbasins. Due to the absence of areal distribution of sandstones carrier, the hydrocarbon migration distance was relatively short. Major faults or fissure zones were the vertical migration pathways. The proven play by the gas well Lingshui A-1 was the structural-lithological trap of Upper Miocene in the Central Canyon, with high quality turbidite sandbodies. This well confirmed the vertical gas migration from deeper Oligocene into the shallower Upper Miocene trap. The reasons for failures of other wells were mainly the absence of quality sandstone reservoirs or difficulties of lateral migration with long distance. The most favorable prospects are the similar traps in the Central Canyon in Lingshui Sag, belonging to the same play of Lingshui A gas reservoir. The secondarily favorable prospects would be several faulted anticlines in southern Baodao Subbasin. Conclusively, large exploration potentials remain in the deepwater and further wells would be drilled soon.\xa0', 'The current Argentinean & Uruguayan continental platform extension reaches to 200 nautical miles; however, at present the Argentinean & Uruguayan government has requested the addition of 150 nautical miles more. This represents an additional area. One of the subjacent ideas behind this request is that subsea resources are exploited, oil and natural gas among them. The increase of the domestic energy demand in the following years will be significant and part of it could be supplied by offshore resources. This would imply the research and development of new technologies that apply to exploration and production of hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas) not only in shallow waters, but also in the deep waters. In this paper we present an estimation of the total volume of resources to justify the necessary investments given certain economic parameters. This estimation is based on a development plan using Platform and Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel and other subsea equipment for deepwater operations. This plan includes oil production forecast, drilling and completion schedule of production and injection wells, sales forecast with economic and financial estimations based on local market conditions. Furthermore, reservoir characteristics that make these resources recoverable are described to support the general assumptions of this paper. Additionally, the current market and political context are described in order to identify possible obstacles to sustainable development of offshore petroleum resources. It is possible to say that offshore development in Argentina & Uruguay is not significantly dependent on technology availability, as extensively on market considerations and political framework. Radical steps must be taken to change foreign investors’ perception of the domestic environment to encourage capital expenditure at the same time as to nourish local professionals and workers to enable Argentine’s & Uruguayan’s resources to grow and develop sustainably.', '', '', '"The spread of shale developments has expanded to every continent. However, each country or continent has found different challenges to be more difficult. In this paper, distinctive stages of three major challenges are discussed with solution examples from around the globe. a.

This can perhaps only be alleviated by resorting to a different pattern of energy reliability with a focus on efficient and reduced consumption, improved mass transport and a new energy source like shale gas. Among all unconventional energy resource of India, shale gas looks most promising going by the experience of the US. The need of the hour is to quickly identify and monetize the reserves. Availability of infrastructure and technological competency may not be a challenge as India already has more than 50 years of experience in exploration and production of oil and gas from conventional sources. The day is not far when a substantial portion of India’s energy requirement will be met from shale gas. This paper provides an insight into the future energy scenario of India with a sneak peek into the shale gas prospects of the country. The effort is to broaden the outlook of technocrats and bureaucrats from a doomsday scenario of the country falling into an energy trap to a plausible scenario, where dependence on energy imports can be reduced to a minimum by concentrating on shale gas.', 'Colombia is 28th economy in the word, with important resources: 21th crude oil producer in the world with 1004,000 barrels per day, 40th of refined petroleum products: 316,500 million tons, 41th of natural gas: 11,260,000,000 cubic meters, 10th of coal: 85.8 million tons per year. Colombia expects 10 billion dollars in international investment in the mining-energy sector in 2013. Colombia nearly doubled crude production during the previous seven years. Rising exploration indicators: 131 exploratory wells were drilled in 2012. The goal is to increase the reserves/production ratio, today this is 7 years, and consequently the first challenge is increasing of reoccurring factors. Currently it is about 18-19 percent, so the goal is to increase by 10 percent during the next 20 years adding more than 3 billion barrels of oil reserves. This can be met by implementing new technologies such as improved & enhanced oil recovery, which can also be used on currently producing fields, as well as new ways available to redevelop mature fields: new reservoir models, new drilling technologies and surface facilities with investments in old fields, to provide new production and cash flow. To increase transportation capacity an investment of about 5 billion dollars will be needed. The bicentenario pipeline will add up to 120,000 barrels per day. Currently transportation goes to the Caribbean (Atlantic), the project in preliminary stages is a pipeline to the Pacific with 250,000 barrels per day. The second challenge is unconventional oil and gas (shale gas & liquids, tight gas & oil, heavy oil & bitumen, coalbed methane & gas hydrates) exploration and production. Colombia has seven basins of those recourses, the third country after Argentina and Brazil in South America with the highest potential for unconventional reservoirs, presuming the positive investment climate. An analysis of unconventional oil and gas modern trends and future needs in Colombia with projection to 2030 was carried out in this work.', 'In 2011, Lightstream Resources initiated a dry gas injection enhanced oil recovery (EOR) pilot at their Creelman Bakken field. The Upper Devonian-Lower Mississippian Bakken formation is an extensive dolomitic siltstone unit containing a significant accumulation of oil reserves in North America’s Williston Basin. At 920 meters subsea (1540 m TVD), this tight oil reservoir has a porosity of 10-12% and permeability under 1 md. Primary recovery in the Bakken is traditionally low necessitating the evaluation of EOR options to extend the economic life of the field. However, the tight reservoir matrix presents an obvious challenge with waterflood design, as voidage is difficult to replace and maintain with limited injectivity. The necessary filtration and timeframe for adequate support also add challenges. With compressibility, lower viscosity and significantly higher injection volumes, natural gas presents a more effective means of accessing the matrix and replacing voidage. Lightstream’s horizontal development of the Bakken in the Creelman area is at 160 acre spacing. The pilot project is designed as a 1:8 toe-heel injection pattern, with a one mile horizontal in-fill well supporting eight perpendicular producers to the north and south. Gas injection rates within the pilot have varied between 10 and 25e 3 m 3 /d, resulting in an instantaneous voidage replacement ratio of 0.7 to 1.1. Currently, depressed pricing in Western Canada has presented natural gas as an economic injection fluid. Injecting primarily C1 allows for effective EOR and long-term gas storage. In addition, the potential vaporizing effect of injected dry gas picking-up NGL’s may result in further reserves. Pilot results have been encouraging to date, as oil production in the pattern increased from an initial rate of 21 m 3 /d to a peak rate of 46 m 3 /d within 12 months of the start of injection. Current oil production is a stable 39 m 3 /d. Natural gas injection could result in significantly improved recovery factors and project economics.', 'Accenture published the paper, “ Water and shale gas development ” that examined water regulation, water usage and management, and water movements in US shale gas development and the lessons learned for international shale gas developments in Argentina, China, Poland and South Africa. The report found that: • Regulation will continue to be specific to the basin taking into account the geology, water situation and local characteristics • Water tracking requirements will increase. • Reuse of flowback water is becoming common practice, but produced water reuse continues to be more challenging • Water treatment and waste water disposal is the bigger issue in areas where UIWs are not an option • Investment and R&D is increasing in: – Closed loop systems of water treatment and reuse – Water treatment technologies – Development of regional water treatment facilities – Use of alternatives to potable water in hydraulic fracturing – Reducing water movements through logistics optimisation, building of pipelines, and onsite water treatment and reuse • Basin level collaboration between operators could provide the opportunity for structural cost reduction of the basin. However, water is not only an environmental area to be managed, it is also a significant operational lever. In some operations, water movements account for 60-80% of physical movements. Sourcing and disposal of water is one of the highest individual cost components. In addition, waiting for water can delay fracturing operations and have a knock on effective on overall well cost. Operators’ water strategies – eg. building pipeline networks to avoid trucks, maximizing reuse, investing in technologies that reduce water volumes, etc…- have also resulted in significant competitive advantage. In addition, basin level collaboration on water sourcing, recycling and movements, would improve the overall water footprint of the basin. This paper will build on the findings of the first Water and Shale paper, examining specific water best practices and technologies that can be deployed in international shale developments to improve operational efficiency while supporting the sustainable development of unconventional resources.', 'West Siberia contains one of the world’s most prolific oil and gas basins. Production has focused on conventional reservoirs and as production declines, unconventional reservoirs such as the Bazhenov Formation, have the potential to offset this decline. The Bazhenov Formation is an Upper Jurassic siliceous shale interval approximately 40 meters in thickness. It is one of the primary source rocks in the West Siberia Basin that has generated the majority of the vast amounts of oil and gas contained in the conventional reservoirs. Its capability as a reservoir was discovered in the 1970’s, many years before the unconventional shale gas and tight oil expansion recently seen in North America and other areas of the world. This initial production from the Bazhenov came from old vertical wells with sub optimum completions. The Bazhenov Formation is analogous to many of the proven tight oil plays in North America where many lessons can be learned and applied to West Siberia. A key to commercial success has been the identification of favorable trends for the particular play being pursued. These are understood by the integration of subsurface data and systematic testing of new drilling and completion techniques. Similar to conventional plays, reservoir characterization and description are critical to understanding the reservoir distribution and quality. Once the reservoir is characterized, commercial challenges can be addressed. Economic development and production is facilitated by cost reduction in drilling and completions as well as efficient use of facilities. Advances in horizontal drilling allow greater access to the reservoir. Recent advances in hydraulic fracturing stimulation techniques, many developed in N. America, further extend wellbore contact to the reservoir through connected, open fractures. Extensive field infrastructure already in place in West Siberia will enable wells to be placed on production quickly to determine the long-term production capability of the resource.', 'Tight oil resources of Changqing Ordos basin are quite rich. Estimates of hydrocarbon resources in Changqing Ordos basin is about 2.5 billion tons, by far the largest tight oil resources basin discovered in China, which has a great potential for oil exploration and development in the future.Characteristics of microscopic pore structure of Changqing tight oil reservoir were studied by using rate-controlled Hg penetration, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and centrifuge. The results indicated that the proportion of nanoscale throat was greater than the sum of proportion of sub- -micron and micron throat in the tight oil core samples.When the permeability was less than 0.3mD, the capacity of porous flow mainly depended on the submicron throat and when the permeability was more than 0.3mD, the capacity of porous flow mainly depended on the submicron throat and micron throat. By using NMR and centrifugation, the paper determined that the minimum limit of throat radius for movable fluid in tight oil reservoir was 0.05?m and the movable fluid percentage of tight oil core was far lower than that of the ultra-low permeability core. The movable fluid volume controlled by different radius throat in the core was also calculated. Based on these researches, the affection of effective development with different well types combinations and different development schemes were studied by using reservoir numerical simulation technique. The results revealed that in staged fracturing horizontal wells, the development efforts of applying CO 2 injection for replenishing energy was the best, while water injection took the second place and depletion was the worst.', 'The Bakken unconventional resource play located in the United States, (Williston Basin, North Dakota) represents perhaps one of the largest oil deposits in the Western Hemisphere. Estimates suggest that 7 - 24 BBOE of technically recoverable resources lie within extremely tight reservoir rock sandwiched between organic rich “source” shales. Historically, companies have struggled to produce hydrocarbons in economic quantities due to the very low permeability and porosity characteristic of the Bakken formation. However the advent of new technology (horizontal drilling combined with enhanced hydraulic fracturing), favorable commodity prices, and a relatively continuous and predictable reservoir have rendered previously un-economic resources financially viable over an area covering approximately 520,000 square kilometers. Today, numerous stakeholders are in an active stage of development with more than 200 rigs operating in the Williston Basin and over 6,000 horizontal wells drilled to date. With Statoil’s prowess as a technical forerunner, the achievement of increased production and reservoir optimization is a persistent goal. In just six years, North Dakota’s oil production has grown from 100,000 BOEPD to over 800,000 BOEPD, as Statoil’s current Bakken production is on the path to exceed 50,000 BOEPD. Yet, approximately 70 - 80 percent of the wells required to optimally drain this resource remain undrilled. As such, despite meaningful achievements in total recoverable oil production, a significant opportunity for future innovation remains and substantial growth is expected. Ultimately the future pathway to continued success in unconventionals will involve technological breakthroughs and advances in Improved Oil Recovery (IOR). Therefore; the roadmap to a new tomorrow starts with the global application of Bakken innovations and operational expertise to unconventional, liquids-rich reservoirs throughout the world.', 'Investigation of shale gas was initiated in Poland in 2011 when a report from the United States Energy Information Agency estimated the country to have technically recoverable reserves of 5.3 trillion cubic meters - enough to meet domestic demand for 300 years. In March 2012, the Polish Geological Institute issued new estimates for Poland´s shale gas resources. In the conservative scenario, resources are estimated at 346-768 bcm. The higher estimates indicate that Poland&#39;s total reserves could reach 1.9 to 4.1 trillion cubic meters indicating that reserves may be more abundant than estimated by the Polish Geological Institute. Even these reduced reserves are sufficient to change the energy market in Europe. There is still much need for exploratory drilling in Poland, as existing estimates vary greatly as to the size of reserves. To date, 48 wells, including 6 horizontal, have been drilled, more than anywhere else in Europe. It is expected that around 300 wells are needed to determine whether Poland could realistically produce shale gas. To date only four horizontal wells have undergone multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. Not one has obtained gas at a commercial rate but Poland has begun a test extraction of shale gas in amounts not seen in Europe before. For example, the Lane Energy Poland, controlled by ConocoPhillips, is now extracting some 8,000 cubic metres of shale gas per day at a test well. Polish national company PGNiG also obtained promising inflow of gas and oil from shale formation. This paper discusses results of present fracture jobs focusing on reasons of unsatisfactory gas inflows, and presents some forecasts of possible further production based on computer simulations calibrated using real data from well testing.', 'In India, shale deposits are estimated to hold more than 63 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas and found across the Cambay basin, Gangetic plain, Assam and many coastal areas. In India the energy ‘demand vs supply’ gap has increased with the focus on developing all possible energy sources. Unconventional gas resources, including shale gas have the potential to contribute significantly for decades. Cambay Basin is an intracratonic rift graben and petroliferous basin of India which has contributed to immense hydrocarbon resources for the nation. The Pre Cambrian Basement complex forms the basements for overlying sedimentary sequences (Olpad formation, Dadhar formation etc.) encountered in a few wells in the basin which also depend on geological settings. It was evident from the Two way time (TWT) contour maps that the thickness of Cambay Shales are more than 100m and are to be targeted as a reservoir from a commercial point of view. A good estimate of TOC carried out using the logs shows that TOC in these zones range from 2% to 9.5% which is quite good as per international standards. In many cases it was observed, that the primarily perforated interval for oil, did yield gas also during the testing period. This was also an indication that the Cambay Shales do contain oil and gas which has the potential to become a target for production of gas. It was observed that there was a systematic increase in the gas content; C1 to C5 content became high by entering the zones. In this paper, the focus would be given to shale gas prospects in India, its policy and field study made on Cambay Shales; hence the paper attempts to showcase the various zones located in Cambay Formations which could form attractive targets for Gas Shales in India and for rest of the world.', 'In order to evaluate possible ways for the exploitation of potential oil reserves characterized by waxy oils, the technical feasibility has been investigated to develop waxy oil fields by means of two technologies, which are already applied in refineries, but to be considered innovative to upstream oil production. The oils under evaluation are waxy, extra-viscous oils, characterized by high pour point. Reservoirs with these characteristics may be found in Sub-Saharian areas. The present study addressed the possibility to develop these reserves by means of two non-conventional technologies for the upstream production: Dewaxing and Visbreaking. For the first one, the idea is to set up an in-situ plant to separate wax from the oil. The de-waxed crude oil could be then transported directly by pipeline. In the second case, the properties of the streams should be improved by means of a visbreaking process. The evaluation shows that, based on the properties used in this study, the visbreaking is more effective in improving oil transportability. The obtainable improvements are moderate, so a careful balance of costs and benefits should be determined on a case by case basis.', 'In most countries with petroleum production, it is well known that great economic relevance has been given to unconventional reservoirs, particularly to those coming from shale rocks. Mexico is no exception, and a very ambitious applied-research project was approved last year. The aim is to characterize and understand the seismic response of shale oil/gas reservoirs using several geophysical scales and establish the optimal scientific conditions of exploitation. The main activity of the project is devoted in the design, acquisition and processing of 3D-3C seismic data in two prospective areas in northern Mexico. The seismic acquisition program is based on the most recent technology applications that include: a) High density and full azimuth options, b) Improving the illumination of subsurface units and c) Developing the seismic data processing by the means of azimuthal images to achieve both, fracture detection and elastic inversion. The last activity, will allow the prediction of brittle and ductile zones in the sedimentary packages that are needed to identify sweet-spots. Seismic imaging is more important for well steering and hazard avoidance. Petrophysical and fracture density measurements, rock physics studies and VSP´s available data will be more critical to establish the sweet-spot detection and the design of production wells and completion by hydraulic fractures. In this work, the calculation of optimal parameters for 3D-1C and 3D-3C seismic data acquisition is presented. The data processing flows to perform accurate interpretation of the obtained information leading to create high resolution images of target formations, are given. The most relevant cases of multi-scale calculations and quantitative interpretations of acoustic and elastic results are evinced. In order to reduce the uncertainty in the volumetric evaluation of prospective resources and seismically identify the opportunity areas with the highest hydrocarbon potential, results of the wave propagation analyses are illustrated.', '', '', '', 'Future energy for Russia will come from additional investment justified by an increased valuation of reserves. Western Siberia is well known for its abundance of laminated, siliciclastic reservoirs. Due to technical limitations of the past, the value of the oil or gas reserves within such reservoirs has been difficult to quantify and typically undervalued. Laminated, hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs are electrically anisotropic; evaluating them with conventional resistivity tools and computational methods commonly provide pessimistic results. A new generation of wireline tools and analytical methods were purposely developed to provide accurate valuation of reserves within such reservoirs. Triaxial induction measurements of horizontal and vertical resistivity, as well as formation dip and azimuth, are used to determine the true resistivity of the oil-bearing sand laminations. Integrated, high-resolution bulk density and neutron porosity measurements quantify total formation porosity as well as the porosity of the important sand laminations. Magnetic resonance measurements provide essential information on the fluid properties and rock quality. The comprehensive volumetric analysis for the laminated formation provides an accurate reservoir summation for reserves valuation. As our field examples demonstrate, the oil company and Russia have added significant value to their oil reserves that may otherwise have been underestimated, undervalued, or bypassed.', 'In March 2013, Total launched its new High-Performance Computing (HPC) facility at its Scientific and Technical Centre in Pau, France. With a 2.4 Petaflops capacity, Pangea as it is called, is among the most powerful computers owned by a private company worldwide. This paper reviews the significant advances brought by this facility for exploration and production workflows. Today’s Total acreage spans a broad range of depositional settings such as Rift Systems, Pre-Salt Carbonates, Abrupt Margins, Large Deltas and Foothills, where prospectivity and reservoirs are increasingly complex to image and to characterize. Meanwhile, shrinking exploration periods require accelerating cycle-times. Only days after starting Pangea, CPU time for a WATS Reverse-Time-Migration (RTM) in a deep offshore field in Angola was reduced from one month to 54hr, and a Kirchhoff PSDM in Gabon pre-salt prospect ran in 3.5hr instead of 48hr before. Such time-saving power also allows running processes at levels thought unfeasible before: Full-Wave Form Inversion (FWI) on a field in Azerbaïdjan would have never been possible before. HPC also impacts our exploration operations: higher resolution velocity models help improve pore pressure prognosis and thus reduce HSE-risks of sub-optimal well design. Another priority for Total is to shorten cycle times from Discovery to First Oil. Time-saving has to be achieved in a context where the simulated flow models tend to become geologically more complex – with an ever increasing number of grid cells - and where the physics to be simulated includes sophisticated thermal or chemical recovery processes. Next Generation Reservoir Simulator INTERSECT® takes full advantage of Pangea thanks to its powerful parallelized capabilities. Total, co-owner of INTERSECT® source code, develops HPC-customized versions and workflows to quickly respond to specific engineering needs on challenging fields. In the future, HPC will further contribute to Total’s efforts for better understanding and characterization of complex flow mechanisms, for EOR or unconventional reservoirs, through numerical rock and pore network modeling, or molecular simulations.', 'With oil and gas fields increasingly becoming more difficult to discover and produce, so the role of seismic technology to generate images of the subsurface grows ever more important. The industry has needed to find ways to acquire seismic surveys more safely and efficiently, and to a high enough quality to enable leading-edge subsurface characterisation to be carried out over increasingly complex reservoirs in often difficult areas both onshore and offshore. In this paper I review one aspect of BP’s response to this challenge – the development and deployment of simultaneous sourcing, also known as blended acquisition. BP has deployed two techniques in North Africa and the Middle East, where conventional acquisition could not have fulfilled their challenging business, HSSE and technical requirements. BP has also extended simultaneous source acquisition to ocean-bottom-seismic surveys with great success. This paper presents the story of the development and the impact of simultaneous sourcing for both the onshore and offshore environments in terms of operational efficiency, data and image quality, and safety. Future challenges include the potential to apply simultaneous source technology in non-desert terrains – where access for seismic crews can be extremely difficult – to help acquire surveys to the necessary quality and efficiency.', 'The challenges faced in finding new hydrocarbon deposits or optimizing production from existing fields have never been greater. Industry is confronted by ever increasing complexity in the subsurface and by new environments characterized by high risks and high costs. Therefore, it is essential that we fully maximize the information available in existing and future geophysical data sets. While tremendous effort is directed to the design of new seismic acquisition systems, current seismic processing methods typically utilize only a subset of the data collected due to limitations in both software algorithms and computer capacity. The advent of a new generation of peta-scale super computers is enabling seismic processing researchers to implement a technology called full wavefield inversion (FWI). Industry is currently applying a variation of FWI to build low frequency velocity models to be used in more traditional seismic imaging; however, these applications only scratch the surface of the benefits FWI could provide. The paradigm shift envisioned occurs when FWI is employed to construct detailed, high-resolution property models of the subsurface that exploit the full bandwidth of the seismic data. High-resolution FWI products, for example Vp, Vs, porosity or lithology, will change the way we interpret seismic data. Interpretation of the subsurface directly in a rock property domain will replace traditional mapping of seismic reflections, at boundaries between rock formations. We have developed new concepts and algorithms that allow for the rapid inversion of multiple subsurface parameters at frequencies that encompass the full seismic bandwidth. This presentation will highlight successes and remaining challenges in the application of FWI using both synthetic and real data from exploration and production environments.', 'Shale gas development has been booming in China in the last few years, but it is still far beyond expectations although some breakthroughs have been made in some individual shale gas wells. As a successful development technique, staged hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells has been widely used in shale gas development especially in North America. In order to investigate hydraulic fractures initiation and propagation in shale, physical experiments were done with shale outcrops. The tests were done in a heavy load frame with cubic specimen (300mmX300mmX300mm) and fractures propagation were monitored using acoustic sensors installed on different location of cubic surfaces. Fracture propagation was then verified with fracture path from dyed fracturing fluid and CT scan after the test. The impact of stress difference, fluid viscosity and pumping rate on fracture propagation and the complexity was evaluated for hydraulic fracturing design improvement. Those measures in hydraulic fracturing design include slick water as fracturing fluid for brittle formations, combination of slick water and gel for formations with minor stress difference to avoid premature fracture diversion so as to increase stimulated reservoir volume, and varied pumping rate for formations with developed beddings to achieve fracture extension in all those beddings. Improved fracturing design resulted in stimulation success in shale gas development in Sichuan basin and gas production for one well reached 112,000 cubic meters per day.', 'For the first time in Europe , a carbonate reservoir has been characterized while drilling using data from chemical and mineralogical analysis on cuttings directly made at rigsite. This approach, originally designed for the exploration of unconventional resources, has been applied for a development well, in a deep dolomite reservoir (Po Valley, Northern Italy ), where conventional data acquisition, mainly based on log analysis, was not possible due to the extremely severe bottomhole condition (HP-HT, slim hole). The approach has been planned to improve the lithological identification of the drilled sequences, enabling to differentiate between primary tight limestone and dolomitized porous intervals, in a context where the utilization of specific drilling technologies, as turbo-drilling with Polycrystalline-Diamond Compact (PDC) bits, generates artifacts that may hinder recognition of original lithotypes and interfere with the geological interpretations. Considering the above constrains, an on-site geochemical laboratory has been deployed while drilling. The system consists in specific tools designed for field usage: an hand-held X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer and a portable X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD), utilized to carry out respectively the elemental composition and the mineralogy of the drilled samples. These analyses are usually performed in remote laboratories and the results are available after weeks or months while, in this case, chemistry and mineralogy were measured directly at rig site during drilling and the results available within few hours. A dedicate workflow to maximize the effectiveness of the techniques has been developed including accurate planning phase and dedicated procedures for sampling, cuttings treatment and quality control of the measured data. . The technologies utilized and the associated workflow have enabled to obtain a better formation characterization while drilling, well defining the potentially productive intervals, permitting correct stratigraphic correlation with nearby wells and optimizing the wireline log program, with significant cost savings. Furthermore, these data have supported operational safety, preventing possible lost circulation, giving a strong contribution to casing point identification and helping to identify contaminant elements in the analyzed cutting.', 'The traditional coupled geomechanical analysis of a reservoir depends on the solution of a fluid flow problem and a stress problem. We present a methodology which takes into account the triggering events history in the reservoir dynamics. Normally changes in the state of stress in a reservoir are relatively smooth and gradual during production, until some field development or geological events of mechanical importance take place. These events may trigger abrupt changes in the state of stress of the reservoir solid framework and the pore pressure, requiring a tighter coupling. These changes prompted to devise a smart strategy to define the critical times in the reservoir history to couple, thus allowing to reduce the time step when large changes in stress happen or to relax the time step when small gradual changes are taking place. This strategy reduces significantly the computational cost of the analysis. Typically, the fluid flow problem for reservoir simulations is solved using finite volume method (e.g. Eclipse®). For the geomechanical solution we developed a finite element simulator which is parallel and capable of solving several millions of unknowns. The two simulators were coupled with a C++ interface code enforcing different coupling strategies. For this study, a generic case study was simulated applying one-way coupling and two-way coupling schemes. In the one way coupling, only the resulting pore pressure from the reservoir simulator is communicated to the Geomechanics simulator at the specified time steps defined by the triggering events. In the two-way coupling, in addition to the communication from the fluid flow simulator, the Geomechanics simulator communicates the pore/perm updates back to the fluid flow simulator. A comparative summary of the results from our method with selected published data will be presented.', 'In order to determine the source rocks and their potentials as a basin, the geochemical analyses are carried out to the outcrop samples which are gathered from the field or core and cutting samples from the wells. The results of these geochemical analyses show the current potential of the source rock as a result of the geological evolution of a basin. Especially, when the source rock is in mid to over maturity window, its initial potential is decreased due to generated hydrocarbons. However, the initial values of the source rocks are necessary for the most accurate approach within basin modeling studies. Some of the wells from Turkey were used in this study. The difference between the current HI and Tmax values obtained from the pyrolysis analyses and the calculated initial HI and Tmax (immature) values derived from calibration of the source rock indicates significant amount of hydrogen loss and increase in Tmax values of the source rock through geological time.The purpose of this study is not only to introduce a new perspective for making a good estimation for the initial values of the source rock but also attracting the attention to misclassification of the kerogen type according to current HI and Tmax values of a mature source rock using modified Van Krevelen diagram.', 'The Barmer Basin is a late Cretaceous to early Tertiary intra-cratonic rift basin, located in the western part of Rajasthan, north western India. Sediment thickness exceeds 6 kilometres in the main rift depocenters and overlies Proterozoic basement. The main phase of exploration in this basin began in late 90’s and seismic data were acquired over most of the basin, with more than 150 exploration and appraisal wells drilled to date. In addition, a large amount of data has been collected on source rocks, oils, heat flow measurements and rock properties in both wells and from outcrop sections. These data have been incorporated into a detailed petroleum systems analysis to understand the hydrocarbon generation and charge prediction.An integrated methodology was adopted for construction of a robust regional petroleum system model which incorporates a set of gross depositional environment (GDE) maps for the main source unit (Barmer Hill Formation), the major reservoirs (Fatehgarh, Dharvi Dungar and Thumbli formations) and both intraformational and regional seals. The amount of Himalayan orogeny related uplift/erosion was calibrated to apatite fission track and vitrinite reflectance data. A regional 3D basin model with appropriate thermal scalars was constructed by calibrating the 1D models across the basin.Measured kerogen kinetics was used to improve the source rock model. The regional 3D migration model derived from this specific kinetics was calibrated to the known distribution of discoveries, charge volumes and hydrocarbon shows in the basin.Source rock characteristics indicate that the northern Barmer Basin is dominated by oil-prone lacustrine source facies whilst the southern Barmer Basin contains both oil- and gas prone facies. The use of measured source kinetics in the 3D model has provided critical insights to the spatio-temporal generation and distribution of migrated hydrocarbons which is being used to high rank remaining prospective areas in the basin.', 'Application of Intelligent Field concept is now becoming one of the most popular ways of creating and managing the operational excellence of the Field/Asset/Operator. Depending on the companies’ goals and priorities each of the organizations takes its own way of how the Intelligent Field is interpreted within the company and further implemented. The term Intelligent Field has got very broad meaning nowadays – from the number of wells equipment with permanent downhole gauges, to operations management system where the decisions are made on the basis of the real-time data feed and cross-functional collaboration; from purely IT project to Organizational Change initiatives. One more very important goal for the Intelligent Field implementation is Knowledge Management – especially for the Majors with the assets operating in different geographies. The reality about the Intelligent Field now is that this concept could be successfully and economically efficiently implemented in both green and brown fields. LUKOIL as one of the World leading oil and gas companies runs its operations in different parts of the World, and daily faces various technical, operational and organizational challenges in its fields. In order to even better succeed in overcoming these challenges, the Intelligent Field Concept was developed together with major world experts in this matter. According to this Concept the main goal for Intelligent Field implementation is to ensure continuous production optimization and improvement of the operational efficiency throughout asset lifecycle. This is to be done through integration of business processes, organizational, personnel, informational and technical aspects of the operations. This model has to cover a number of standard and uniform business processes such as Production Optimization, Integrated Asset Modeling, Integrated Activity Planning, HS&E and others. The pilots are now being implemented in three LUKOIL overseas projects in Iraq (oil, green field), in Kazakhstan (oil, brown field) and in Uzbekistan (gas, combination of green and brown fields). Achieved results already demonstrated positive impact on the overall operational efficiency, but what is more important – revealed numerous areas and process for further re-engineering and optimization.', 'Sensitivity study of hydrodynamic models of heavy oil reservoirs and basin models demonstrated that high quality data on thermal conductivity (TC) and volumetric heat capacity (VHC) for reservoirs and caprocks leads to essential improvement in economic and technological efficiency of heavy oil production and reliability of basin modeling. The new methods and instrumentation developed during the last several years for TC&VHC measurements on cores and core cuttings at bench and formation conditions, allowed to develop the qualitatively new workflow of thermal property investigations. The first stage consists of continuous non-destructive non-contact profiling of TC&VHC on as-received full size cores and cuttings just in core storages with spatial resolution up to 0,5 mm with estimation of thermal anisotropy coefficient. The profiles are used for heterogeneous rock analysis (HRA) and selection of the most representative cores for following measurements at elevated pressure (P) (', '', '', '', 'With the gradual deepening and development of oil/gas exploration degree, the exploration objectives are being changed to complex reservoirs from the conventional reservoirs, and the exploration areas are being transferred to the foreland basin and front zone of the mountain from the interior of the basin, so, many problems are confronting us in mountain seismic exploration, which are resulted from the complex structure conditions in complex mountain areas, including complicated and diversified near surface structures, complex steep subsurface structures, as well as heterogeneous reservoirs. Aiming at the characteristics and the difficulties of mountain seismic exploration, and in respect of seismic acquisition, the paper presented such techniques as interference wave systematic test technique, mini-receiver point tomographic LVL investigation, CRP attribute analysis-based geometry design technique, wide line & long geophone array acquisition technique, 3D wide azimuth acquisition technique, seismic engineering remote sensing technique and so on; in respect of seismic processing, we developed mountain static correction technique series, multiple-domain joint noise attenuation technique, high precision prestack velocity modeling and depth migration technique; in respect of seismogeological integrated interpretation, we developed complex structure pattern building technique, variable velocity structure mapping technique, fracture detection technique, reservoir prediction technique and fluid recognition technique and so on. By using integrated technique of seismic acquisition, processing and interpretation and integrated application of engineering techniques, the quality of the seismic data in complex mountain areas is improved greatly, the accuracy of the seismic imaging is enhanced obviously, and the precision of the complex structure and reservoir prediction is also improved. These techniques have been widely applied in many complex areas, such as, Sichuan basin, Tarim basin, Junggar basin, and Ordos basin, has discovered quantity of oil/gas structures, and promoted the important discovery of the oil- and gas-bearing zones in west China.', 'Volcanic rock hydrocarbon reservoirs might be underestimated in exploration and exploitation due to three-dimensionally heterogeneous distribution of volcanic lithofacies. Volcanic-related reservoirs are not among the primary producers of hydrocarbons in a global sense. However, further exploration and exploitation of volcanic reservoirs with an appropriate geological model may offer considerable potential for the discovery of significant reserves. An understanding of the architecture of volcanic reservoirs is critical for their exploration and exploitation. We applied multiple-point geostatistics to the modeling of volcanic rock reservoirs in the Yurihara oil and gas field, in northeast Japan. The volcanic rock reservoirs in the Yurihara field consist of basaltic rocks erupted underwater during the Miocene period: sheet flows, pillow lavas, breccias, and hyaloclastites. This volcanic activity was related to the opening of the Japan Sea, a backarc basin behind the Japanese islands. Volcanic morphology in slow spreading mid-ocean ridges is used as a modern analogue in developing a training image in the multiple-point geostatistical approach. Two conspicuous volcanic morphologies can be found in slow-spreading ridges: (1) flat-topped seamounts (dominant sheet flows and surrounding pillow lavas) and (2) hummocky terrains (conglomerations of pillow lavas). Identical morphologies and lithologies are suggested in 3D-seismic profiles in the basaltic reservoirs of the Yurihara field. The formation of flat-topped seamounts along en echelon-aligned fissures and surrounding hummocky terrains was modeled as a training image for the Yurihara basaltic reservoirs. Realizations were developed using borehole imaging, logging, and core data as hard data and were successfully used for flow simulations. The application of multiple-point geostatistics to volcanic reservoirs has been demonstrated to be proficient in predicting reservoir performance through simulations using geostatistical models.', 'The objective of our work was to carry out a petroleum geological study regarding migration routes, hydraulic trapping, occurrence of potential reservoir rocks and spatial distribution of pressure and reservoir properties in a petroleum-bearing basin. Our work was based on an integrated geological and hydrogeological research on Late Miocene-Early Pannonian formations in the basin, particularly focusing on deep-water turbidites. We used the (hydro) geological model based on the results of this work as a key input for building a hydrodynamic model with which we could later assess the natural flow system and hydrodynamic conditions of the area studied. Reconstructing the depositional environment types and the related lithological type units enabled us to estimate petrophysical and hydrogeological parameters in little-known areas of the basin. Based on these approximations a more reliable hydrodynamic model was built. The model enabled us to determine the main directions of petroleum migration and to approximate the relative timeframe of hydrocarbon entrapment. We also identified possible areas for hydraulic trapping of HC’s which were verified by exploration results. Using our model we are also able to predict the spatial distribution of pressure in the basin with special regards to the severity of overpressure. The results of hydrodynamic modeling demonstrate several practical applications: - Predicting the spatial distribution of pressure and especially overpressure is of global importance from interrelated economic, technical and HSE aspects. - The determination of migration pathways is of crucial significance from the exploration point of view. - The presented method can be powerful in both well-explored mature areas and less-known territories and is independent of scale, there are numerous examples of successful application at both regional and local scale.', 'As illustrated with globally aggregated results and also examples from several basins, complex basins are characterized by: · High spatial and temporal heterogeneity driven by multiple petroleum systems, active tectonics, and the interaction of fundamental controls. · An extended history of exploration, development, and production that is resistant to rapid “creaming”. · Multiple new play openings, and important learnings over this long history, including “surprises” late in play life. Effective exploration and exploitation of such basins requires a disciplined approach that includes these factors: · Continuity of effort and knowledge, especially at a regional and play scale. While digital capture and archival of fundamental data and interpretations is essential, the development of human capability is the most important factor in remaining an effective explorer in complex basins. · Effective development and application of new technologies. Especially impactful is improved seismic technologies, such as Full Wave Inversion, subtle DHI recognition tools, and improved acquisition (e.g., long offset, wide azimuth, multi-component, etc.). · Rapid anticipation, comprehension and recalibration of paradigms with drilling and other results. In complex basins, new plays extend the exploration lifecycle. Early recognition of a new exploration concept or play element is a competitive advantage, as most value capture in new plays occurs early (first mover advantage). · Consistent approach to opportunity characterization, especially resource assessment and risking. To effectively deploy company resources, an accurate and objective estimation of risk/reward/cost facilitates better portfolio investments in the face of a fiercely competitive landscape.', 'Petroleum exploration in fold-thrust belts (FTB) is usually a high risk venture, particularly in remote areas with rugged topography, heavy vegetation cover and difficult logistics. Challenges include difficulty in detailed structural mapping due to lack of outcrops, quality seismic imaging due to rugged terrain and complex fault-fold geometries and drilling steeply dipping fold limbs in areas with poor logistics. The FTB in NE India and adjoining areas of Bangladesh and Myanmar is known to be a hydrocarbon province for more than 120 years. The FTB is characterized by a series of approximately N-S trending highly elongated anticlines. The Mizoram exploration block is located within this FTB and contains sixteen anticlines and intervening synclines. Analyses of surface structural data show that anticlines are upright or slightly inclined with sub-horizontal axes whereas the synclines are sharp to flat-crested. The limbs dip steeply, reaching more than 60º at places. 1352 GLKM of 2-D seismic survey has been carried out within the block. However, owing to highly rugged topography seismic lines had to be along existing road and pathway leading to crooked seismic lines. This, together with tight upright folds having steep limbs, makes data processing, migration and depth conversion a big challenge. Consequently, seismic images are usually fuzzy and reliable structural interpretation based on seismic profiles and identification of suitable drilling location becomes a difficult task. In such a terrain, initial exploration strategy including drilling locations can be decided on the basis of section balancing and restoration using kinematically valid fault-fold models. Incomplete data set available for the Mizoram block does not allow derivation of any robust structural model but leads to multiple kinematically valid structural models. This in turn helps better risk assessment in this area where seismic imaging of sub-surface structures is usually a big challenge.', 'Many of the well known Iranian hydrocarbon reserves have been accumulated in the Asmari carbonate reservoirs of the Zagros fold-thrust belt. In some oilfields, Asmari reservoirs are associated with a detrital sequence called Ahwaz sandstone or Ghar Formation. These sandstones are very porous, and matrix porosity is usually main factor controlling quality and storage capability of the reservoir. However, many of these reservoirs don&#39;t have uniform porosity, therefore, porosity modeling is very important to recognize reservoir complexities. This paper presents new findings concerning porosity pattern of the Ahwaz sandstone reservoir in one the SW Iranian oilfields. The field is an N-S trending anticline which is located along the Hendijan-Bahr Gansar paleo-high (Arabian trend). The reservoir was divided in three zones mainly consisting of shale, cemented sand, and loose sand which are separated by shaly interbeds. The reservoir porosity was analyzed and modeled based on geological data and petrophysical logs of seven wells, by using numerical techniques and Geostatistical algorithms of the Petrel. The results were presented as various graphs, cross-sections, and maps about reservoir porosity, facies, and thickness. The porosity maps/sections show that porosity pattern is heterogonous in all reservoir zones. In addition, the trend and degree of porosity changes is varied from zone to zone. Variation of the porosity pattern is presented as interruption and displacement of the reservoir units in cross sections and maps. Furthermore, comparison of the porosity maps with the facies and Iso-chore maps implied that vertical and lateral variations of the porosity pattern have been controlled mainly by sedimentary facieses and diagenetic processes. However, the reservoir quality is strongly affected by tectonic activities of the Hendijan-Bahr Gansar trend, too.\xa0', 'Most of the Middle East gas reserves are found in carbonate reservoirs. As a result of their origin and post depositional transformation, the pore space is quite complex in structure, pore geometry and pore size aspects. The dominant carbonate minerals are dolomite and calcite, commonly associated with a variable content of anhydrite and episodic presence of minor siliciclastics. The anhydrite content, if improperly accounted for, negatively impacts the well log interpretation and ultimately affects the reservoir production and development plans. Anhydrite layers thicker than logging tool vertical resolution can be properly determined by basic log suites. Anhydrite nodules, smaller than the tool resolution, can be detected but not quantified nor resolved. Disseminated anhydrite, however, requires spectroscopy logging tool input for volumetric determinations. These gas-bearing complex carbonate reservoirs commonly contain layered, nodular and disseminated anhydrite, the latter as either matrix-replacive or as a pore filling cement. A rigorous quantitative petrophysical analysis with the basic triple-combo logs for other than a resolved layer anhydrite habitat is not possible. Spectroscopy and imaging well logs can substantially improve the formation evaluation. The presence of discrete anhydrite nodules, for example, can lead to a perception of poor rock quality from the basic log suite analysis, when in fact the carbonate portion can have good porosity and good permeability. Underestimating anhydrite volume (in the absence of spectroscopy data) will result in underestimation of grain density and, consequently, an underestimate of the log porosity by as much as 3 pu. Spectroscopic elemental analysis for the carbonate matrix, which leads to dry-weight mineral fractions and then lithology are acquired by the neutron capture and inelastic neutron scatter spectral logging tools. The formation evaluation is improved because the spectroscopy data directly indicate the presence of sulfur which is contained in the anhydrite mineral. Quantitative mineral volumes from neutron capture and inelastic spectroscopy significantly improve porosity computation and consequently impact the hydrocarbon saturation computation, particularly in these complex lithologies. Results can be further enhanced by local calibration with core data. Examples highlighting the improved formation evaluation that result from the inclusion of well log spectroscopy data in gas bearing complex carbonates are reviewed in this paper.', 'For decades the most prolific traps to be drilled in the chalk of the Danish Sector were clear structural traps, especially 4-way dip closures located on salt diapirs and other compressional structures. With the Halfdan discovery, it was demonstrated that the peculiar character of the chalk reservoir also allows for less traditional “trap” styles. This paper reviews the concept of “trap” for chalk prospects. Along with stratigraphic traps, the future of the chalk prospectivity in the Danish Sector relies on non-classic trapping styles that may open new, hopefully prolific, sub-plays. These new concepts require a new mind-set for chalk explorationists. The standard seismic mapping may provide a geometrical description of a prospect, but it will rarely define the “closure” of the prospect itself. To define the volumetric distribution of the hydrocarbons, it is thus necessary to use all available geophysical and well data. Moreover, it is also necessary to have a thorough understanding of the charge of the prospect, with emphasis on entry points and timing. Finally, all these data have to be integrated to build static and dynamic models, which can be used to test the feasibility of new concepts. In light of this, we suggest that low permeability plays as the Chalk Group of the North Sea have not to be considered as a conventional play, but rather as a semi-conventional play, with all the implication this fact might have when assessing regional prospectivity.', 'This study has been made based on Basin Modeling Project in the Persian Gulf Basin covering an area of 80,000 sqkm with 100,000km of 2D seismic profiles. This paper tries to explain halokinetic movements encountered while interpreting seismic data in the Iranian territory of the Persian Gulf Basin. However, importance of halokinetic role in hydrocarbon trapping and fluid migration is incontestable; this effect is more pronounced in the Persian Gulf Basin as this one in terms of hydrocarbon bearing is considered as one of the well known prolific basins in the world, hence, ample attention has been paid analyzing this phenomenon at basin scale. It should be reminded that a relatively thick layer (about 2km) of Precambrian salt sits over basement and in turn phanerozoic sedimentary column (sometimes more than 7 kms thick) sits over this salt, hence, producing conditions favorable for an eventual salt movements or creating surface decollement. Our concern in this study would be limited to identification and study of accumulated salt within sedimentary layers manifested by different features. But imaging salt by itself poses problem specifically where other origins (Eocene for example) have also been attributed to formation of salt, in that case, dissociating and analyzing salt of different origins would not have to be so practical, within this frame, the following results have been gained so far: a- We approached to tackle salt origin(s) where seismically hardly to attain imaging with confidence. b- Integration of geological evidences associated with calculated amount of salt permitted to comprehend better rheology of salt and model inconsistencies existed in some parts of the Basin. c- Uncertainty studies have been applied in order to validate calculated salt volume.', 'In carbonate rocks, the processes of sedimentation, lithofication and diagenesis, particularly dissolution, produce a wide range of pore sizes, resulting in a complex pore distribution and pore connectivity. The reservoir characterization was studied by core analysis, and the methodology of research is Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The amount of calcium carbonate, salinity, temperature, and pH of water can control the reservoir properties particularly types of porosities, permeabilities and various pore-size distributions. Because of their reactive nature, carbonates go through a more complicated deposition and diagenesis compared to siliciclastic sandstones. Recent studies have recognized the significant role of dissolution in carbonate rocks through precipitation, lithofication, and diagenesis. It has been shown that the different fluid pH levels in the rock results in various dissolution scenarios. Carbonate formations generally have various complex pore structures. Over 50 core samples were prepared from the oil field in the Middle East. They were cored, cut to proper size and then cleaned and dried. The plugs were used in a series of core analysis tests which were coupled with low field NMR measurements. In this technical study, pore size distribution new modeling and dissolution phenomena in the heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs are presented. Pore size analysis in carbonates sheds light on the pore structure and ultimate recovery. Accordingly, dissolution affects primary, secondary and tertiary porosity, and also increases the vuggy porosity. These can lead to changes in permeability as well. The NMR pore size new modeling can clarify the problems which are regularly a critical control on reservoir quality, and it can help to better characterize heterogeneity and thus enhance producibility of carbonate reservoirs. This fundamental study gives a better description of pore size distribution, pore connectivity and pore classes in carbonate reservoirs.', 'Reservoir studies examine the importance of geologic, engineering, and economic parameters to formulate and optimize production plans. If there are many factors, these studies are high-priced unless simulation runs are applied and analyzed efficiently. Reservoir modelling requires integrated reservoir data and economic parameters. Integration is complex, because parameters such as permeability drive mechanism, structural framework, and fluid saturation distributions, are uncertain. I.e. Uncertainty inpermeability could be caused by prediction at unknown locations from inexact seismic data, poor distribution of precise well data and imprecise seismic data. Therefore the impact of uncertainty levels in key geologic and production parameters such as NTG, permeability, porosity, vertical transmissibility, skin factor must be assessed. This system on a single sector carbonate reservoir unit was applied through a development planning case study based on Field Development Plan. Ultimate recoveries, profiles, and economics for the range of possibilities are evaluated. Sarvak formations are known as oil bearing intervals which have previously been argued by monitoring oil, show almost immediately during drilling time of the earliest wells. This paper shows how the uncertainties in interpreting the environment of deposition have been reduced by the integration of data from different sources and how the interpretation was used in predicting the reservoir properties across the field, thereby enabling the successful models of two reservoirs in a field that did not have core data. A fit-for-purpose workflow whose main objectives are the assessment of probabilistic STOOIP and static connectivity are presented. Another objective is the quantification of the key static model uncertainties on both volume and connectivity. A benefit of this structured and practical workflow is providing an un-biased way to select P10, P50 and P90 geologic models based on oil-in-place and static connectivity as ranking criteria.', 'It is generally agreed today that thin oil-rim reservoirs are very challenging in terms of developments. At the exploration and appraisal stage it is crucial to acquire a complete understanding of the reservoir fluids and contacts, especially the gas-oil contact (GOC) and water-oil contact (WOC).These contacts are vital for determining the resource in place (for economic planning and for regulatory reporting) and for designing the drilling and completion strategy. However, the task of contact determination can be especially difficult in low permeability reservoirs. In this paper we consider implementation of advanced Well Formation Testing (WFT) technologies for the purposes of determining where gas cap and water aquifer edges are located along the reservoir and proving initial compartmentalization suggestions. The challenges of acquiring representative reservoir fluid samples in both WBM and OBM environments as well as in low permeable reservoirs are considered. We also present our findings for best practices in PVT lab procedures. The results we achieved with WFT and subsequent fluid analysis were implemented in reservoir modeling and well production prediction that was compared to real well test results obtained in several wells.', 'The salt bearing basins are widely distributed in the world; the Caspian basin is a typical salt bearing basin. The distribution and deformation of salt-gypsum layer have an important role in controlling hydrocarbon accumulation factors and its impacts go through the generation, migration , accumulation and preservation of the hydrocarbon. Meanwhile, the deformation of salt-gypsum layer brings significant challenges to exploration technologies. Physical and numerical simulation experiments show that the major reasons for the forming of such salt structures in Caspian basin is gravity slip and differential compaction. The salt dome’s height increases from the edge to the center of the basin, up to 5000 meters, with the type of salt structures changing from salt roll to salt dome. The physical simulation experiments of hydrocarbon accumulation show that the large-scale structures and lithostratigraphic (including reefs) reservoirs are formed in the subsalt strata and all kinds of traps associated with salt structures are generally formed in the post salt strata, such as the reservoirs shielded laterally by salt domes and fault block reservoirs above salt domes. It’s the technical challenge that the identification of subsalt traps and reservoir prediction are researched, because of the salt structures in Caspian Basin. The subsalt traps are recognized accurately through the combination of salt dome characterization , different methods of pre-stack depth migration, and forward modeling. The subsalt carbonate reservoirs are predicted accurately by the laboratory analysis , petro-physical analysis , multi-wavelet decomposition and seismic multi-parameters’ inversion. Using the above techniques, CNPC discovered several large oil fields in the Caspian Basin and reserved a series of exploration targets. \xa0', '', '', '', 'A resulting challenge from rising mature field development costs with oil price remains, on how to generate sustainable competitive advantages through efficient technological innovations, making cost-effective solutions a crucial part of rigless intervention strategy. With strict onshore and offshore compliance requirements, the need for operational excellence, and several process improvements, necessary to yield dividends in the form of safe project delivery and overcome several technical difficulties, is vital. The scope of the paper is to examine rigless stimulation and logging technologies used in the timely execution of one of the largest field developments in Saudi Arabia to cost effectively enhance matrix stimulation success. Some include solutions for CT reach, CT access for dual laterals, acid placement optimization, and treatment effectiveness monitoring. CT extended reach solutions comprise tapered CT string for ultra-deep wells, drag reducers, tractors and agitator. Technologies for CT access for dual laterals include flow activated multilateral tools for CT matrix stimulation that use pressure variation telemetry with BHP and CCl/GR for high success lateral identification. To optimize acid placements, a combination of distributed temperature survey, pressure, temperature, and casing collar locator measurements, enhances diversion and acid placements. A blend of tools assist to monitor, analyze, and adjust in real-time the interaction between reservoir and stimulation fluids. Self-diverting viscoelastic diverting acid, facilitates better diversion in thief zones. Unique solutions for monitoring treatment effectiveness evolved to include real time production logging/ injector reservoir profiling using single strings for both CT stimulation and real time production logging instead of memory logging. Field data analysis reveals operational and cost benefits from deploying technological solutions and justifies the degree to which each technology solution fits the overall field development strategy. Implications of deploying these solutions include the reduction of well counts from the original estimates in this field development to offer manageable total field development costs.', 'Northeast Sichuan Area is rich in natural gas resources. Sinopec has discovered some large gas fields in Puguang and Yuanba district. These gas fields are characterized by deep buried depth (exceed 6000m), high formation pressure (equivalent density reached 2.3 g/cm 3 ), high hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide content (20% H 2 S content and 8% CO 2 content in Puguang Gas Reservoir) and multiple pressure system distribution. Especially in the upper continental formation, the drilling job is hard to carry out because of high formation pressure, high rock abrasiveness and stratum fracture development. The outstanding problems include Low penetration rate, frequent circulation loss and etc. By applying the integrated matching technologies, such as well bore structure optimization, air/foam drilling, managed pressure drilling and composite drilling technique, ROP of these area is substantially increased. Some measures such as Plugging while drilling, bridging plugging and chemical gel plugging technologies are developed to solve the complex formation leakage problem. Since 2005, more than 100 wells were drilled with 100% success ratio.', 'Description: The Sakhalin-1 project, operated by Exxon Neftegas Ltd., is located offshore Sakhalin Island in remote Eastern Russia and includes three oil and gas fields – Chayvo, Odoptu and Arkutun Dagi. The drilling and completion related technical and operating challenges of the Sakhalin-1 project are many. The project has relied heavily on Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) and robust completion technologies to simplify the operations, maximize capital efficiency, and minimize the environmental footprint. ERD operations at Sakhalin-1 have required a balanced engineering / operational approach – built upon a thorough understanding of the physical complexities, the insight to provide robust technical solutions, and the operational expertise to implement them efficiently, safely and without environmental incident. Up-front identification of technical and operational limiters of the well plan is critical. Once limiters are identified, engineered solutions are designed, tested and implemented. Technology, innovation and the transfer of knowledge into the operation are critical success factors. This process requires an innovative engineering and support structure with deep technical capabilities that is also conducive to the creation and implementation of new techniques. Undergirding the project is a basic set of operating principles that includes safety, protection of the environment, maintaining the highest standards of business controls, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Results: Efficiently drilling and developing resources while redefining the ERD envelope at Sakhalin-1 requires a solid understanding of the physics involved, and the insight to identify and employ innovative technologies with careful attention to up-front engineering and operational detail. This paper will highlight some of these challenges as well as describe some of the innovative techniques and technologies that have unlocked the Sakhalin-1 resources.', 'In 2014, the oil and gas industry will celebrate 65 years of hydraulic fracturing. Over the years, the number of stimulation treatments in Russia has grown. In the early 1960s, for example, 1,500 jobs were performed per year; in 2012, more than 39,500 operations were performed. This increase is the result of the demand for effective development and redevelopment of low-permeability formations and mature oil fields. Hydraulic fracturing effectiveness has become a key focus for Russian oil-producing companies over the past decade. Optimization of the fracturing fluid parameters is one of the fundamental elements of the whole reservoir stimulation process. Six main milestones in the evolution of fracturing fluids in Russia over the past 10 years can be identified: 1) the revision of the requirements set for quality of fracturing fluids which included the introduction of the so-called “shear stress” test and stability tests for pad, middle, and last proppant stages; 2) designing fracturing fluids for stimulation treatments using large-size proppants; 3) optimization of fracturing fluids on the basis of produced formation water; 4) improvement of retained fracture conductivity by minimizing polymer loading and optimizing breaker concentration without sacrificing fracturing fluid performance, with documented cases of a 15 to 20% polymer reduction leading to a 100 to 150% increase in productivity index; 5) simplification of fracturing fluid designs by the introduction of a self-buffering crosslinker, which allowed to decrease a number of fracturing fluid additives by half; and 6) development and implementation of the dry version of the borate-based crosslinker to address Russian cold weather conditions, with associated changes in logistics and the development of methods for maintaining high fluid efficiency.', 'Our work aims at providing instantaneous control status of the well to the driller. Propagation of primary acoustic waves through the drilling mud in the annulus (between drillstring and the borehole) is the principle of this model. The velocity of this wave is very sensitive to the changes of the physical properties of the media. This character of the wave is used to monitor any influx from the reservoir. The model is trained with the normal drilling process and any deviation from this is detected instantaneously. Normalized value of severity of kick can be obtained when the maximum tolerance level of the kick for that particular rig is known. During the continuous monitoring of changes in physical properties of drilling mud, a kick can be determined. Upon attaining limiting values of tolerance or level rise of kick in the well-bore, drilling is stopped and Blow Out Preventor (BOP) is actuated to close automatically eliminating the need for consents for the same. This model can be used as an early kick detection method during oil and gas drilling. Upon loss of primary control, drilling comes to a halt and automatically shuts down the BOP. This can be used for automation of the drilling process especially for well control to minimize human errors and for efficient operation. Our proposed model has been simulated using LabVIEW, from National Instruments, to create a virtual instrument and the results obtained had proven effective to use as early kick detection and drilling automation as expected. Conventional methods like close monitoring of Rate of Penetration (ROP), pressure in the drill string, drilling mud pit level gain, flow parameters either misleads the driller or takes a long time to be observed and confirmed till the kick converts in blowout. Our work aims at providing instantaneous control status of the well to the driller.', 'Accelerated efforts of discovering more oil & gas have pushed the drilling activities to more hostile environments, encompassing hard to very hard rocks. While drilling the top hole sections in one of the frontier onland basin, poor to very poor drillabilty was experienced. First 60 meters were drilled consuming nearly 60 drillbits and spending 142 rig days. This was probably the first well where Rate of Penetration (ROP) was being calculated NOT in meter/hour but in mm/hour or cm/hour. This Basin has Proterozoic-Rocks, having Compressive Strength ranging from 10000-40000psi. Air- Percussion -Drilling ’ is a technique in which the more common circulating fluids, water or mud, are replaced by highly compressible Air/Mist/Foam & Gas(preferably Nitrogen). Hard-rock conditions are ideal for Air Percussion Drilling especially in surface holes where imparting Weight-on-Bit(WOB) is an issue. Realizing the potential of Air- Percussion- Drilling in the Industry, study was carried out to implement drill top-hole sections around these wells. Field evidence in this frontier onland basin has demonstrated enormous Time and Money savings on top-hole sections of 9 wells so far by achieving spectacular ROP (including 60m in 142 hours) and eventually lower Cost per Meter. This technology has established the most proficient way to drill hard top-hole sections and shown 200%-500% ROP improvement as compared to Conventional Drilling in offset wells. Considering very high Rig Operating Cost these days, the enhancement in ROP in hard- rock drilling is an opportunity to shrink Non Productive Time(NPT) and overall Well-Cost. And, very precisely that is the motto of all oilman.', 'The study on the influence of various factors to the rate of yield for long-term operated oil wells shows that production and transportation of crude oils undergoes challenges because of high viscosity and freezing point, the anomalous rheological behavior, etc. The rheological characteristics of these oils is shown in the impermanence of their dynamic viscosity and is determined by its colloid-structural state, the composition of the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium, the nature of intermolecular interactions and in self-generation of the nanostructure. In order to reduce the solidification point and improve the rheological properties of crude high-viscosity oil, petroleum engineers apply the following variety of technologies: ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 thermic treatment; ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 dilution of light oil fractions or various solvents; ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 the introduction of additives regulating viscosity-elasticity properties of the oil. \xa0 For the first time GPOGC (Geotechnological problems of Oil, gas and chemistry SRI) investigated that nanocomposites of transition metals possess properties of additive-regulators of rheological properties of oil colloids. These nanocomposites also for the first time were used in order to increase reservoir pressure. We have prepared iron nanoparticles stabilized in the macrocyclic ester cavity, as unstabilized nanoparticles quickly lose their activity and do not affect the process of self-assembly and self-regeneration of oil from the oil colloids leading to an increase in viscosity .The test for the application of iron nanoparticles as additives was carried out in a well No: 1557 of Siyazan field (Azerbaijan). The rheological properties of oil after adding iron nanocomposite additives and processing with liquid nanomembrane, increased from 74.57 % up to 81.6 % , the viscosity was decreased from 10 sst up to 4,5 sst, and the number of mechanical impurities was reduced from 25% to 19%. As shown, the rheological properties of crude oil after the introduction of iron nanocomposites have improved significantly. \xa0 \xa0', 'Mittelplate is Germany’s largest oil field, located offshore in the tidal flats of the Wadden Sea. Although operating in an environmentally sensitive area, it has successfully produced 30 Mio m³ oil until its 25 th anniversary end of 2012. This paper summarizes the most relevant technological steps in past and future with respect to drilling, production and transport, which themselves correspond to increases in production and reserves. The field was discovered in 1980, and after appraisal the production island was erected. First stable production was achieved from an inverted five-spot pattern in vertical wells with ESPs, whereas the produced oil was transported by double-hulled barges. In 1994, drilling the first horizontal well resulted in almost doubled production. The subsequent horizontal well turned out to be effectively appraisal and led to an increase of reserves by factor two. To bypass the bottlenecks caused by barge transportation and offshore rig capacity, it was decided to access the reservoir from onshore in parallel to the drilling activities on the production island offshore. This resulted in a further 3D-seismic campaign, further exploration wells and eight Extendend-Reach-wells with 6-9 km length, accompanied by the state-of-art technology for directional drilling and geosteering; production increased by more than 50%. In 2003 a transport pipeline was approved which rendered the use of barges for oil transport dispensable and resulted in a further production boost. The offshore rig was upgraded and its operational radius was increased from 2 to 6 km range. This provided ground for the most recent technological achievement which is a duo-lateral well in 2010, providing a threefold production when compared to a vertical well. The current rigline foresees in the midterm further duo-lateral wells. The subsequent development of the southernmost part of the reservoir will require combining both extended reach and multilateral technology.', 'In recent years, with the availability of high-performance automated drilling systems, the drilling challenge has moved to even further critical operations involving deepwater and ultra-deepwater environments, HPHT applications, anomalous pressure regimes and reduced margins between pore and fracture gradients. Even though prevention comes first, achieved through best practices and master operating attitude, the availability of tools and procedures to cope with critical events is very important. Nowadays, whenever necessary, a best oil industry practice is represented by Managed Pressure Drilling Systems. These systems consist in a set of surface tools and equipment that enhance drilling capacity and grant a safe drilling process. In case of emergency, the reaction is usually fully devoted to these systems and the blowout preventer (BOP). For many years, the possibility of introducing both static and dynamic safety barriers directly into the well has been considered to limit the intensity of kick events and achieve a consistent increase of safety. This paper describes two field experiences (in the US and Italy) achieved with downhole isolation packer subs that can be integrated in the drillstring to operate in an open hole as well as above the last casing shoe. Risk-assessment advantages obtained with this technology are also analyzed and reported. As dynamic barriers, downhole isolation packers complement conventional BOP systems and work in combination with them, to: stop a kick close to the bit, improve well integrity and optimize well control procedures. In case of a kick, while closing the surface BOP is according to standard practices, a downhole isolation packer, as part of the drillstring, can be activated by means of a downlink. The well annulus will be shut in, trapping the kick below the tool, thus enabling it to condition the mud above it and to bullhead the kick back into the formation.', 'Drilling of oil and gas fields with high H 2 S and CO 2 content is one of the modern trends. Under such conditions all companies around the world use very expensive special corrosion-resistant casing and tubing with high content of chrome. In Timan-Pechora area of Russia where such condition can be found in some fields, LUKOIL together with Weatherford Company and Aquatic DP Company developed casing strings and tubing of aluminum alloy. Special alloy was inert to H 2 S and CO 2 in combination with high strength-to-weight ratio. In addition, a special acid solution was developed for downhole treatment. The project was implemented successfully.', '', '', '', 'The South Arne field, located in the Danish sector in the North Sea, has been in production since 1999. Initially, the field was developed with production wells only, but water injectors were added after 1½ years which increased the potential of the field significantly. Currently the field is operated with 20 wells (7 injectors and 13 producers). All wells are fitted with sliding sleeve doors that allow zones to be opened or shut. This provides the valuable opportunity to pursue a more efficient recovery of oil by manipulating sliding sleeve doors – both in injecting and producing wells. A streamline simulation model has been built with the purpose of optimizing the water injection strategy. It will demonstrated that a streamline simulation provides valuable understanding of the sweep patterns in the reservoir and that improved quantification of injector-to-producer dynamics leads to added reserves. Operations on sliding sleeve doors in injectors alone leads to a ~1% increase ultimate recovery. The benefit is mainly due to decreased water production and prolonged well lives. The optimized injection strategy leads to changes in the sweep patterns between injection wells and their associated producing wells with a decreased quantity of produced water as a result. Consequently, the optimal allocation of lift gas is likely to be changed along with the optimization of water injection. The combination of water injection optimization coupled with an optimized gas lift allocation will be discussed and the benefits will be quantified.', 'An effective reservoir management is fundamental to better operate reservoirs and enhance recovery throughout field life. It involves an overall knowledge of the oil and gas business with a special focus in data acquisition and analysis, development strategies, reservoir and well model simulations. This paper presents the experience of a successful reservoir management methodology applied to an Eni asset in the North Slope of Alaska. This work has involved a multidisciplinary team consisting of petroleum, reservoir and production engineers in head quarter and on the field. An in-depth analysis has been performed to identify an efficient strategy for water injection management focused on production optimization. The methodology is based on an efficient data collection linked to an automated surveillance system. It automatically performs customized analysis on daily basis, leading to new optimization opportunities. A greater attention has been given to the investigation of voidage replacement ratio for each injector/producer system. This represents a fundamental step for planning an efficient water injection management, highlighting areas that need tailored actions. Fine tuning of each action has been performed using a reservoir model updated with all the new available data i.e. new CPI interpretation, PVT analysis, SCAL, tracers and production data. The model is continuously updated by an integrated team that involves the sedimentologist, the petrophysician, the geologist and the reservoir engineer. Once the production optimization actions have been deployed on the field, a continuous surveillance has been carried on through ongoing performance evaluations to assess the effective incremental oil and the economic gain. The proposed methodology is an example of a sound and robust reservoir management that was successfully applied to a real field case giving an effective improvement in oil production.', 'The updip Zone 4 Injection (UZI) miscible gas EOR project in the Prudhoe Bay field was started 12 years ago and there remains a potential for further expansion. Field performance of the existing patterns has been analyzed and a numerical simulation model has been developed to study the EOR benefit of the UZI process. The concept of the UZI process along with pilot performance was presented by McGuire et al in 2006 (SPE 101681, From Concept to Pilot to Full-Field Implementation: A New EOR Process for the Prudhoe Bay Field). This paper provides a follow up to the project and presents results of the field performance analysis and the type pattern model simulation. Both field and simulation results show that there is significant secondary recovery benefit from water injection into the updip Zone 4 area, and that the tertiary benefit from miscible gas injection is not as large as that in the conventional patterns. The primary reason has been found to be due to the migration of the miscible injectant (MI) updip into the gravity drainage area. The results of this study provide guidance in the planning and optimization of miscible gas injection EOR projects in Prudhoe Bay and similar oil fields.', 'Managing high water cut wells in carbonate reservoir is very challenging. Streamline technology is an ideal reservoir management tool for mature fields as it can identify unswept reserves, water recycling between wells, and provides important information such as allocation factors and dynamic patterns. Identification of these well-pair interactions is very useful as a surveillance model and allows for quantifying the offset production with injection volumes, and easily allocating efficient vs. inefficient areas of injection. In this paper, we present the use of streamline simulation to manage water production and injection by reducing water injection in key injectors, with overall improvements to oil production. The field is located in a large anticline, features consisting of two domes (North and South) that are confined between two thick anhydrites. Production is supported by peripheral water injection and the reservoir is well suited for streamline simulation. Recent reservoir surveillance monitoring data showed some injected water at the top of the reservoir, consequently, a rapid increase in water cut in key wells in the northern part of the reservoir was reported. Streamline surveillance data was used to identify well pairs interactions and injection efficiencies. A sector optimization study was performed and opportunities were identified using the streamline simulation outcome along with the other reservoir surveillance tools. The results indicate that reducing water injection volumes on this sector will have a great impact on oil production and will result in a reduction in the produced water volumes. A new water injection strategy was implemented and a decrease in watercut was achieved in targeted producers from 45% - 20% with overall watercut dropping from 10 - 5%.\xa0', 'BZS oilfield is a large heavy oil (30-260mPa.s) reservoir with narrow (100-300m wide) and thin (2-8m thick) fluvial channels first developed in Bohai bay, China, by CNOOC and Chevron. It is characterized as a complex fluvial channelized reservoir where small meandering channels were deposited at different geological times cross-cutting each other. Early production showed steep pressure and production decline because of lacking natural energy. Due to relative large well spacing (350-450m), it is difficult to characterize the connectivity between sandbodies and determine the response of oil production on water injection. The results of water-oil displacement in cores explicit that there is no non-water production period and the recovery factor would not surpass 5% when field water cut reaches 70%.Targeting these prominent problems in the reservoir, we have applied comprehensive production optimization techniques based on study of detailed reservoir characteristics: 1) Combining research on geology and field outcrops and analysis of reservoir dynamic performance, we carried out detailed reservoir description of sandbodies and systematically analyzed the response of oil production on water injection for this type of reservoirs; 2) An innovative technology of production optimization has been developed. It takes the nature of offshore production technology into account, constantly adjusts water injection rate and controls water production amount so that water displacement efficiency is improved; 3) An advanced surface water injection and production technology such as selective water injection supporting the implementation of the production optimization techniques has been also developed.Field production data showed that almost all producers within injection-production well patterns displayed positive responses from water injection resulting in stable reservoir pressure, oil production, and slightly water cut increase. The filed oil rate has been stabilized for about four years without water breakthrough in large scale and the overall recovery factor is expected to improve more than 6%.', 'There have been many methods investigated to increase recovery from gas reservoirs. In volumetric, compression decreases abandonment pressure, while water flooding slows or stops pressure decline but decreases the hydrocarbon pore volume (HCPV) at abandonment. While these methods do increase recovery, none of them alone can optimize it. The work contained in this study combines two previous enhanced gas recovery techniques i.e.; coproduction of water and gas from water–drive reservoirs and water flooding gas reservoirs. The two techniques allow the control of reservoir pressure and sweep efficiency through planed production or injection of water. A recovery optimization method, which is applicable to any gas reservoir, was developed using the concept of pressure and displacement management (PDM). The purpose of the PDM application is to bridge the gap between material balance and simulation. The application is intended as a screening tool that is fast and easy like material balance, but also predicts production rates and allows incorporation of surface constraints like reservoir simulation. It consists of reservoir, deliverability and wellbore models that allow the input of constraints like flowing tubing pressure, water injection and production capabilities and aquifer influx. The PDM application is intended as a screening tool to evaluate different production scenarios and techniques of enhancing recovery in order to achieve optimization. Two field cases are analyzed in order to demonstrate the idea of recovery optimization and the versatility of the PDM application. In the case of the water flooding study it was concluded that the injection rate necessary to obtain a given recovery factor in a given amount of time, with a limited injection volume goes up significantly over time, and beginning water injection early in the life of a reservoir can have several advantages to performing a water flood near abandonment.', 'ASP flooding is a novel tertiary oil recovery technique, which has been developed for further enhancing EOR in Daqing oilfield. Field tests showed that the recovery rate can be improved by 20 percent higher than water flooding. For a typical heterogenic oilfield, taking Daqing oilfield as representation, due to permeability considerable differences varied in different layers, commingled ASP fluid injection with single molecular weight polymer might block the layers. As a result, it is difficult to improve the downhole injection profile effectively. Numerical study showed that better developed results could be achieved by using molecular weight polymer in ASP fluid matching injetion for heterogenic multilayered oilfield on longitudinal. The recovery rate could be improved by 2 percent based on commingled injection. In this paper, a separated molecular weight and pressure injection technology for ASP flooding has been developed based on microscopic mechanism and analog simulation studies. A special ASP fluid injecting string for separating molecular weight and pressure was designed on the condition of keeping the same surface investment. The injection string can apply different molecular weight polymer fluids in ASP injection for different layers as required, matching with the permeability differences of reservoir on longitudinal distribution. The injection volume and formula weight of ASP fluids for zonal layers can also be controlled. The molecular weight is regulated from 20 percent to 50 percent and the choke pressure difference can be up to more than 2.5MPa. The maximum viscosity loss ratio is less than 8 percent. Field test in near a hundred wells showed that the injection profile was improved effectively and the pay-gross thickness ratio was increased by 8 percent after using this technique. It will play an important role on the development of mature oilfield in future.', 'Reservoir monitoring is an important aspect of prudent reservoir management to sustain productivity and achieve higher hydrocarbon recoveries. Monitoring is a process that comes in various forms, such as that of flood front advancement and reservoir saturation changes and quantification. Designing and implementing an effective monitoring program to track fluid advancement and quantify remaining oil saturation is a reservoir management best practice that ensures optimum sweep is achieved; and hence crucial for all fields, regardless of their state of maturity. The necessity for such programs becomes more critical as fields mature. Reservoir saturation monitoring programs are usually faced with several challenges, including: mixed and low fluid salinity, tool limitations, borehole conditions and reservoir heterogeneity. Overcoming these challenges requires comprehensive programs that encompass adoption and integration of various derived saturation techniques. This paper will discuss a reservoir monitoring program of a large carbonate field that has produced continuously for several decades. The monitoring program includes “key monitoring wells” in addition to drilling new evaluation wells that are strategically selected and are mostly located in well flooded areas. Time-lapse production and fit for purpose saturation logs are run in the existing wells, while extensive in-situ measurements of fluid saturation are collected in the case of the new wells, to monitor saturation changes and track fluids movements. The paper will also discuss the various methodologies adopted to address the aforementioned challenges. It will illustrate how the monitoring program has aided in tracking fluid movement, quantitatively determining fluid saturations and assessing sweep efficiency (E d , E v and E a ). In addition, the paper will show how the collected information was a catalyst in identifying sweet spots in flooded regions, and hence guiding the development activities to maximize recoveries, especially from mature areas.', 'This High Pressure and High Temperature gas field which is still producing at its initial plateau can deliver a very high gas rate. The field development was based on results from three exploration/delineation wells, which confirmed a thick gas bearing group of carbonate reservoirs that were logged, cored and tested. However, many questions about these reservoirs remained unanswered. Reservoir continuity, nature of the faults, presence of natural fractures and their characteristics, strength of the aquifer are some of those uncertainties, which have to be addressed in order to better manage this mega-resource in hand. The paper describes an integrated data analysis, reservoir management and surveillance plan to understand these reservoirs, optimize the wells and reservoir performance. All available drilling, coring, logging, testing and production data were analyzed systematically. Image logs, other OH logs, together with DST and core data provided a good understanding of the reservoir quality, variability, and natural fracture characteristics. Existing pressure transient and flow testing data were utilized to accurately model inflow performance of the wells. Production and pressure data were analyzed to gauge aquifer strength. Various forecast scenarios were simulated. A detailed uncertainty quantification led to an updated reservoir management and surveillance plan. Plan has been drawn up for extensive deliverability testing, interference and transient pressure surveys using surface and permanent down-hole gauges. These data will help us improve reservoir conformance and identify/optimize stimulation candidates, where well intervention calls for very meticulous planning and execution at a very high cost. Monitoring well is planned to help further assess the aquifer size and improve confidence in this giant gas field management and long term sustained forecasts.', 'Chemical flooding EOR techniques, mainly including polymer flooding, chemical combination flooding and foam flooding, play more and more crucial role in China oil industry. Field tests proved that chemical flooding EOR techniques could be applied successfully in onshore reservoirs in China. Challenges also exist as the chemical flooding EOR applied in different reservoirs. The current developments of chemical flooding EOR techniques were introduced and the key technologies and remaining challenges were discussed in this paper. Polymer flooding has entered into industrialized applications stage. By the end of 2011, 54 industrial blocks of polymer flooding have been applied in Daqing oilfield and average 13% incremental oil recovery over water flooding have been obtained, ten key techniques for polymer flooding have been formed such as polymer screening and evaluation, low viscosity loss facility of injection, high performance preparing and injection equipment and craft, eccentrically-wearing inhibiting technology, separated layer injection etc. Chemical combination flooding especially ASP flooding has been studied and tested intensively in China. Six pilot and four industrial field tests of ASP flooding have been implemented and about 20% more incremental oil recovery after water flooding have been obtained. A set of techniques for combination flooding has been formed such as ASP formulation optimizing, injection allocation technology, lifting technology, chemicals monitoring of produced liquid etc. Eighteen foam flooding pilot tests have been carried out in China from 1994 to 2010. Good performances have been achieved in sixteen pilot tests. Challenges in polymer flooding faced mainly on new effective polymers for high temperature high salinity reservoirs and low permeability reservoirs. The limitations of ASP flooding were scaling phenomenon which occurred severely and made liquid treatment difficult. Challenges in foam flooding mainly faced gas finger problems in field tests. Some progress have been made in recent research and show good perspective.', 'Long-term continuous microseismic monitoring has assured the integrity of the top seal formation and has delineated geomechanically active faults in the reservoir of Yufutsu oil/gas field in northern Japan, where water is injected continuously into the aquifer beneath the oil column. The observed microseismicity was interpreted and discussed on the basis of integrated studies focusing an interaction between fluid flow and geomechanics. The injection is aimed at maintaining the reservoir pressure at a slightly higher level than the original pressure prior to the start of production and to boost initial production. However, it has raised concern that the increased reservoir pressure might cause failure of the top seal formation. To address this issue, downhole geophone sensors were installed at the reservoir depth to monitor the microseismic activity in and around the reservoir and the seal formations. During continuous monitoring over three years, approximately three thousand microseismic events were recorded, of which more than six hundred were located. The results show that most events were selectively concentrated along specific faults estimated using 3D seismic surveys and that there were no events in the seal formation. This fact clearly demonstrates the integrity of the seal formation, i.e., no geomechanical failure had migrated into the seal formation. The mechanism of microseismic activity along the faults and its downward migration are discussed by using coupled geomechanical and fluid flow simulation, which can provide a theoretical and prospective understanding of reservoir dynamics. Geomechanical integrity of oil/gas reservoirs is an important issue for safe and sustainable operations. The need to limit environmental risks has also been increasing recently with active development of unconventional resources and CO 2 geological storage programs. Permanent or long-term microseismic monitoring is one of the most powerful and economical techniques for surveilling reservoir dynamics.', 'Well and reservoir surveillance data gathering activities can be costly and present a number of logistical challenges and operational risks associated with well intervention work, especially in offshore sour gas fields. This paper describes an approach adopted by RasGas to reduce these risks by implementing a workflow that facilitates a need-based strategy to plan, design and execute yearly well/reservoir surveillance programmes. The workflow also facilitates full integration of all the different acquired data types to maximise their value and improve the understanding of well/reservoir performance. The need for early well and reservoir performance data when a new field is placed on production, often necessitates a calendar-based and broadly applied surveillance programme to develop a good understanding of reservoir deliverability and well productivity trends across the field. These baseline data are used to proactively identify and quantify potential threats to well productivity and production sustainability from issues such as reservoir performance, skin build up from scale or condensate banking, unexpected formation water production, corrosion damage, etc. Once the sufficient baseline data set has been acquired, there is a need to develop an optimum approach towards well and reservoir surveillance programmes. This ensures that these programmes are focused on delivering truly needed data while reducing the risks inherent to well intervention activities. RasGas achieved this optimisation through development of a workflow called “DIET” (Data Integration and Evaluation Technique). Implementation has significantly reduced the reliance on a set-frequency logging strategy, thus reducing overall well intervention job counts, costs and risks. In addition to integrating all relevant data for single well evaluations, the DIET concept has been expanded to integrate and correlate data from multiple wells to enhance understanding of the reservoir behavior.', 'Chemical Tracers have being used to identify oil and water production along different isolated intervals in open hole slotted liner completions and multistage fractured wells. The principle of this technology is to place a number of unique chemical tracer systems in different compartments along the length of the lower completion with only minor modifications, for clean-up and production monitoring. The system releases tracers into the well stream when wetted by target fluid, oil or water. When wetted by the opposite phase they will remain dormant, meaning no tracers will be released. The application of permanent oil and water tracers utilized systems placed at pre-defined intervals along the production zones of the wells. Upon well start up, oil samples are taken at the surface and are analyzed to identify which zones is effectively contributing to oil production. Permanent water tracer systems are installed aiming at detecting the onset of early water breakthrough. After water break-through has occurred, a regular sampling program is performed and samples analyzed to identify the location of water production to understand the downhole water profile evolution over time. The system also identifies the correct working of the open completion mechanical devices (i.e. swellable packers). The presented case studies will discuss the innovative wireless approach and the lessons learned using chemical inflow tracers to a fractured carbonate brown oil field reservoir containing several sub-areas producing asphaltene and clasts, in which chemicals provided greater understanding of characterizing the reservoir and well performance in high deviated wells. Swellable packers have been used to segment the horizontal sections for the purpose of selective zonal stimulation and to optimize water management based on tracer detection.', '', '', 'As the world pursues conventional, unconventional, and emerging energy resources to meet current and future energy needs, it is important to understand the relative environmental footprints of these resources over their full life cycles. Complete and accurate life cycle assessments (LCAs) can provide such insights to support meaningful business investment as well as informed government policy. A well formulated LCA requires proper articulation of environmental metrics, definition of system boundaries, acquisition of accurate and high quality data, development of realistic process models, characterization of data quality, and interpretation of results. We present results of LCAs for power generation from shale gas and for production of vehicle fuels from tight oil, heavy oil, and algae biofuels. These LCAs focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water consumption over the full life cycle of the energy scenario and elucidate which factors are the major contributors , thus highlighting areas for reducing emissions through technical innovation. We also discuss how we account for variability, uncertainty, and data gaps for robust interpretation of the results.', 'In the coming decades, vehicle and fuel options and their supporting infrastructure must undergo significant transformations to achieve aggressive national targets for reducing petroleum consumption and lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Vehicle electrification, advanced biofuels, natural gas, and hydrogen fuel cells are among the promising technology options that are being explored as future alternatives. A number of recent US and international studies have examined how a mix of technology and policy options can contribute to the aggressive goals of 50-80% reduction in petroleum consumption and 80% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050. These include reports issued by the National Petroleum Council, National Academies, US Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, and International Council on Clean Transportation. While these studies all generally point to the need for a portfolio of technologies for the transportation sector, they do not all draw the same set of conclusions for the portfolio mix and potential pathways for achieving GHG and petroleum reduction targets. Moreover, they were commissioned for a variety of reasons, applied different analytical approaches, and used a variety of assumptions in reaching their findings and recommendations. This paper will encompass a synthesis of the various studies, their underlying technology and policy assumptions, and their analytical approaches to enable a more robust comparison across projections for the vehicle and fuel mix.', 'The generation of hydrogen via reforming of a variety of carbon containing feed-stocks in the presence of water is until now, one of the most versatile technologies for the production of hydrogen and syngas. Although these reforming technologies are in principle well established, understood and commercialized, there are still a number of technological challenges that are not solved to a satisfactorily degree and there is a constant demand for appropriate answers to the challenges posed. High throughput experimentation can be a valuable tool in helping accelerate the development of suitable solutions on the catalyst and process development side. In order to be able to generate test data that are close or identical to process relevant conditions, HTE has developed a new technology portfolio of test technologies named Stage-IV technology. In contrast to earlier developments which address more small scale testing on the basis of catalyst volumes of 1ml up to 10ml under isothermal conditions, our new technology portfolio offers the advantage of test volumes at sub-pilot scale also realizing reactor dimensions close to technical applications. This does not only ensure a good mimic of the hydrodynamic conditions of the technical scale, but also allows a fingerprinting of features like temperature gradients in the catalyst bed which play a large role for catalyst performance. Apart from catalyst tests with granulates, when screening for optimized catalyst compositions, the units are designed to accommodate tests with shaped catalysts. In order to demonstrate how these technologies can accelerate catalyst and process development our presentation will describe HTE’s novel High Throughput Reactor equipment and workflows to address the challenges for Syngas production via Steam and Dry Reforming. The focus of our presentation will be on accelerated catalyst and process development from micro-scale to pilot-scale.', 'Residue hydrotreating has become the major process in the refinery within the trend of inferior and heavy crude oil and clean products. Based on the status, future and characteristics of fixed bed and ebullated bed, fixed bed residue hydrotreating process will continue to be in the key development of the next period on the premise of breaking through the adaptability of feedstock and operating cycle bottleneck. Ebullated bed residue hydrotreating process will have a very good prospect after solving complex high investment and operating restrictions, and the combination with fixed-bed can become a new residue hydrotreating technology. It is possible to improve the property of fixed bed feedstock significantly, reduce the content of impurities substantially, and improve the fixed bed operation greatly. Meanwhile, it can enlarge the range of heavy oil feedstock and prolong the operating cycle . The paper argues that both of the two processes can be integrated into various combination and operation mode according to the property of feedstock and product by analyzing technical and economic characteristics. The combination of both can give full play to their each technical advantages and synergistic effect, and can be expected to become the core and leading technology of processing heavy and inferior feedstock in the refinery. The combination process can also expand the source of feedstock for the heavy and inferior feedstock processing, improve the utilization of heavy oil resources significantly, form the new situation of ebullated bed integrated with fixed bed as the core of refinery processing, and improve the overall economic benefits greatly with a good prospect of application.', 'Diesel deep desulfurization is one of the most effective ways to solve the problems of pollutant emissions, such as SOx and PM2.5. The most difficulties in diesel deep desulfurization is the sulfide removal of high molecular weight with steric hindrance such as 4,6-DMDBT. The current method for sulfides removal is mainly through HYD pathway and then desufurization, which has some shortcomings such as aromatics excessive saturation, resulting in high hydrogen consumption and high processing costs, and thermodynamic equilibrium resulting in a narrow temperature operating window and short commercial running cycle length. By carefully studying sulfur removal reaction mechanisms for every step, especially on 4,6-DMDBT, SINOPEC has found a more economical route to eliminate steric hindrance in HDS via ?-alkyl transfer. Therefore, based on the reaction mechanism of these sulfides and differences in hydrotreating reactor zones, four technology platforms have been established as the result of research into the processes and mechanisms of catalytic diesel ultra-deep HDS. These four technology platforms include: 1) novel catalyst supports suitable for HDS of high molecular weight sulfides; 2) controlling catalyst preparation suitable for the microcosmic structure of catalysis materials, adjusting catalyst acidity helpful for HDS via alkyl transfer; 3) active metal impregnation suitable for better dispersion of active metal on carrier, 4) catalyst stacking suitable for 4,6-DMDBT sulfides HDS via alkyl transfer route at high temperature, then the reaction efficiency increased by 30% comparing with single catalyst. These ongoing technologies have been the development of a series of high-performance diesel HDS catalysts consisting of FHUDS-2, FHUDS-3, FHUDS-5 and FHUDS-6, successfully applied in more than 30 industrial units worldwide to steadily produce ultra low sulfur diesel with long running cycle. Especially FHUDS-5 catalyst was approved as “Top tier” in some world famous petrochemical companies exhibiting particularly high performance when applied to ultra-deep HDS. These catalysts and the stacking technology provide a reasonable and economical way for producing ultra low sulfur diesel.', 'OrganoTemplate-Free (OTF) synthesis of zeolite with seed-assisted method is a very novel route to get zeolites. Compared with the conventional zeolites synthesized by organic species directed as templates, OTF route could effectivedly reduce the harmful gas for environment, such as CO, CO 2 and NOx, and also save the raw materials. In the recent 5 years, Beta, RTH-13, ZSM-34, LEV, ZSM-12, ZSM-35 and ZSM-23 zeolites were synthesized in the absence of organic template by using Beta, RUB-13, ZSM-34, RUB-50, ZSM-12, ZSM-35 and ZSM-23 as seeds respectively. However, all of those successful examples were carried out with the same zeolite structures or frameworks. The growth processes show those are “core-shell” or surface crystallization mechanism. Here we choose ITQ-17, another type of zeolite Beta with the structure code number BEC, as assisted seed to synthesize Beta-I zeolite in the OTF system. According to the experiment results: ITQ-17 zeolite firstly dissolved in the mother liquid to form composite building units (CBUs); then the CBUs rebuild with the aluminosilicate species which supplied by mother liquid to form Beta nucleus; With the hydrothermal treatment time prolonged, Beta zeolite was obtained by the growth of nucleus finally. The whole growth process shows the CBUs played template roles to form Beta zeolite structure rather than the ITQ-17 seeds, which is different from the “core-shell” or surface crystallization mechanism, see the figure 1 and figure 2.', 'The growing world energy demand for fossil fuels plays a key role in the continuous increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Gas-to-Liquids, or GTL, is a technology breakthrough for converting natural gas into high performing, ultra-clean liquid fuels, as alternatives to conventional refining of crude oil. In the past ten years, there have been technological advances in developing GTL technology on a larger scale, and several commercial plants have been developed. ORYX GTL, a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and Sasol is a pioneering GTL facility producing premium, low emissions, easily transportable and marketable diesel fuel, naphtha and LPG. The objectives of this paper are a) to identify the various sources of GHG b) to describe methodology to quantify GHG emissions c) history of to reduce GHG emissions and d) opportunities to reduce GHG emissions. The paper is organized in two; the first part presents a brief overview of ORYX GTL process and identifies various GHG emission sources. The second part quantifies GHG emissions and describes the concepts to reduce GHG emissions. A brief overview is also provided for projects completed to reduce GHG emissions via flare reduction program. The major GHG emission sources from ORYX GTL facility are classified as combustion and flaring emissions. The GHG emissions are estimated on composition of fuel streams, energy content of the fuel, available measurement data, emission factors or mass balance approaches. Flaring of tail gas contributes significantly to the release of GHG emissions from the facility. The GHG reduction concepts include use of advanced process control techniques, utilization of tail gas for fuel, and recovery of low pressure vent gases for re-use in process heaters. In 2012, a 23% reduction in GHG emissions was achieved compared to 2011 levels from the facility due to maximized gas utilization as fuel.', 'This talk will cover several specific topics related to advanced spark-ignited engines and gasoline. The first of these will discuss the characteristics of knock behavior of different fuels in SI engines and how to define the anti-knock quality of practical fuels. It has long been known that the knock behavior of a fuel usually cannot be described adequately by either RON or MON alone. In this talk, a program using a modified CFR engine to investigate toluene/heptane mixtures under near RON conditions and develop Toluene Number index (TNI) will be discussed. Of interest will be the determination if TNI is a better measure of a fuel’s ability to resist auto-ignition over a wide range of operating conditions. A second topic will be a discussion of the fundamental processes that govern the characteristics of droplet-induced pre-ignition in SI engines. In this type of pre-ignition, a region of fuel-oil-air mixture with relatively lower auto-ignition temperature could be potentially formed due to the evaporation of the oil droplet. The fuel-oil-air mixture could auto-ignite and subsequently initiates the flame propagation if conditions are satisfied. The physics of droplet-induced pre-ignition will be discussed, with the objective of trying to minimize or avoid the occurrence of pre-ignition in SI engines. A third topic will be a discussion of flame propagation in stratified mixtures. A novel experiment will be described which will allow the measurement of laminar burning velocity through stratifications of equivalence ratio (same fuel) or fuel reactivity (e.g., gasoline fuel and diesel fuel). This has applications to duel fuel strategies where diesel fuel is injected into a very lean mixture of gasoline/air. The experimental apparatus is designed to operate at engine-relevant pressures.', 'Dry reforming of methane using carbon dioxide is an environmentally friendly process for the conversion of two greenhouse gasses into synthesis gas. The conversion of methane and carbon dioxide, the yield of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and the mole ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide are functions of temperature and catalyst identity. Thus, we focused in the present work in preparing novel composite catalysts, made of g -alumina doped with 1 wt% lanthanide (Y, La, Ce, Pr, or Er) and bimetallic cobalt molybdenum carbide. The prepared catalysts were examined in a tubular, stainless steel, continuous flow, fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure, with 1:1:1 mole ratio of methane to carbon dioxide to nitrogen. We found that the identity of lanthanide dopant was imperative for the performance of these catalysts. The conversion of reactants and hydrogen/carbon monoxide mole ratio increased with increasing temperature from 700°C to 850°C for all catalysts except for the one doped with lanthanum, which showed very high, stable conversion (>96%) and stable hydrogen/carbon monoxide mole ratio of ~1.0 over this temperature range. However, all catalysts exhibited stability for reactant conversion and product yield at the optimum temperature of 850°C upon testing for five hours. Catalysts doped with yttrium, praseodymium, or erbium resulted at 850°C in higher yield of hydrogen and carbon monoxide than those doped with lanthanum and cerium. However, all catalysts resulted in ~1.1 hydrogen/carbon monoxide mole ratio, which is higher than the ideal value of one. The findings might indicate that the ionic radius and electronegativity of the lanthanide dopant are key parameters. In addition, the findings explicitly showed that reverse water gas shift, methane cracking, and reverse Boudouard are the main side reactions.', 'In Japan, the oil industry and the automotive industry are working together under the Japan Auto-Oil Program (JATOP) conducted by the Japan Petroleum Energy Center (JPEC), which aims at the resolution of technical issues related to automobiles and fuels. In considering the motor fuel of the future, we must take into account the “3Es.” In terms of energy security, one of the 3Es, diversification of fuel is required. In addition, reduction of CO 2 emissions is demanded from the viewpoint of environmental protection, another of the 3Es. In order to satisfy these two demands, the use of biofuels is being promoted in many regions of the world. In Japan, the mixing of biomass with gasoline is permitted to a maximum of 3% ethanol equivalent, and for E10 compatible vehicles, up to 10% ethanol equivalent is permitted. As for diesel oil, a maximum 5% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) mix is permitted. Under JATOP, in preparation for using biofuel in higher concentrations than the current national standards in Japan for future vehicles that comply with the most advanced emission regulations and meet the highest fuel-efficiency standards, we have carried out evaluation tests in order to identify relevant problems and appropriate measures to resolve them. Based on our test results, we would like to introduce the problems of room temperature storage stability, cold start performance deterioration, material corrosion, and the effect on the exhaust gas after-treatment device, in the use of higher biomass concentrations. The problem of room temperature storage stability of diesel fuel of high FAME concentration is a phenomenon in which precipitates are generated, causing the engine to stall as a result of fuel filter plugging, as the storage temperature is higher than the cloud point. The deterioration of cold start performance is due to a rise in the cold filter plugging point (CFPP). Our test results also reveal that diesel fuel mixed with FAME causes corrosion of some materials in fuel system parts. The problem involving the exhaust gas after-treatment device is that regeneration of the diesel particulate filter (DPF) does not work well when highly concentrated biofuel is used.', 'The refining industry uses more and more hydrogen to get the low sulfur products and the conversion level required by the market. The heavy oil production, the erosion of heavy fuels, inland demand, and the global trend for cleaner product makes the oil refining industry account for half of the total hydrogen worldwide production, far ahead of the second larger consumer-ammonia. A similar trend is expected for the next 20 years. This trend implies increased investments and increased CO 2 emissions. To face the hydrogen demand while limiting the associated costs and CO 2 emissions, IFPEN has developed an innovative process to produce hydrogen. This new process and technology for hydrogen production by SMR at large capacity is called HyGenSys™. The breakthrough innovation is based on the way the heat is supplied to the steam reforming reaction, a specific reactor exchanger and the value of the steam produced in the process. In this concept, the heat required for the reaction comes from pressurized flue gases produced in a combustion chamber external to the reactor exchanger. This latter relies on an innovative compact arrangement of bayonet tubes. With a thermal extensive integration, the overall efficiency is improved and the consumption of natural gas reduced. Moreover, the steam produced by the process is entirely used in the process itself: one part for the reaction and the other to supply a turbine driving the compressor necessary to produce hot pressurised flue gas. The proof of concept of this process has been based on lab tests and on various simulations representing the whole process or focused on critical areas. A full scale single tube pilot plant has been built and performances achieved in the reactor-exchanger are being collected to validate the concept.', 'In refineries, hydrogen is an essential utility to prepare clean transportation fuels. It is not only used for hydro treatment of finished products, but also for deeper hydro conversion of heavier and sourer crude fractions, for instance in hydrocrackers. In most refineries a hydrogen plant is present that feeds into a network that serves the various consumers. Often, recovered hydrogen from off gas streams from hydro processing units or catalytic reformers, is (re-)injected into the network. For modern new refineries or refinery expansion projects the size of the hydrogen plant is significant and typically contributes to 25% of the overall refinery energy consumption and corresponding CO 2 emission. For this reason, energy efficiency is key in the design of the hydrogen plant. In this paper the basic considerations for the design of modern efficient hydrogen plants are presented. Site-specific optimization parameters are addressed as well, such as selection of feed and fuel and co-generation of export steam. Further, the benefits and limitations of enhanced hydrogen recovery from refinery off-gas streams are discussed. Finally the paper will demonstrate that the hydrogen plant is a good candidate for pre-combustion CO 2 removal, thus relatively easily contributing to the reduction of the overall refinery carbon footprint.', 'The use of CO 2 in the synthesis of organic compounds of economical value can be an interesting way to achieve sustainability for its sequestration considering the costs in the capture process. CO 2 can be converted in a variety of compounds of different kinds of applications, including compounds for fertilizers, paints, fuel additives and polymer precursors. Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is regarded as a green solvent and it can be used as a fuel additive or a precursor for polycarbonate synthesis, replacing the toxic phosgene compound in the latter case. The objective of this work was to study DMC synthesis from CO 2 , in the reaction with methanol, using several metal catalysts which include tin organometallic compounds, tin, iron and zirconium oxides, as well as, metal impreganated zeolytes and alumina. The catalytic reaction has been done in conditions of 170 c, 45 bar and 3-6 hours of reaction time. An experimental design has previously been done in order to study the better condition reaction. The products were analyzed by gas chromatograhy coupled with mass spectrometry. The catalysts were characterized and analyzed before and after the catalytic reaction using the following techniques: x-ray diffraction, superfical area (bet), infrared spectroscopy, microscopic electronic scan, nuclear magnetic resonance and thermogravimetric analysis. The conversion achieved was in agreement with the already related data (1-3 %). Chemical suppressors are now being tested in order to increase the percentage of CO 2 conversion. The DMC route for CO 2 conversion should be further investigated since it may be an environmental and industrial interesting use of this greenhouse gas.', '', '', 'The importance of heavy residue upgrading is evident and many research groups are focused on developing efficient and feasible upgrading methods. A new concept based on nanodispersion of active metals in bulk of heavy residue has recently been developed. The basic concept of mentioned patents has been repeated in cold model compounds. The average size of nanodispersed catalysts that is measured by TEM is 20-50 nm. This is the basis of comparison and it doesn’t mean that the exact size of active catalyst of mentioned references in the bulk of heavy feed in reaction condition is necessarily the same. In this study we tried to reduce the size of catalyst by making nanoemulsion of liquid precursors. The main concern with nanoemulsion additives are alkaline metals as a well-known root for coke formation. The suitable surfactants are nominated by considering the above mentioned constrain. Then different formulations of surfactants were made to provide the best hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB). Minimum droplet size was achieved by using the optimum HLB surfactants. DLS method was used to determine the water droplet size. Then metal oxide nanoparticles were produced by heating the dispersed mixtures. The nonionic surfactants were used and by optimizing the best surfactant dosage, we managed to reduce the size of active catalyst by a factor of 10 and average particle size was reduced to 1-2 nm. It means the diameter of active metals is 1/100 of asphalten micelle size. This small size makes the mobility and consequently the activity higher comparing larger catalyst size. It can open new window to pioneering slurry reactor hydrocracker technologies.', 'ORYX GTL, a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and SASOL is located in Ras Laffan Industrial City in Qatar. Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) is a technology to convert natural gas into high-performing, ultra-clean liquid fuels utilizing the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. Wax produced in the FT reactors is cracked to produce high quality diesel and naphtha. The ORYX GTL hydrocracker consists of a single, four-bed Hydrocracking (HC) reactor with associated equipment. Since the initial start-up in 2006, the entire catalyst load in the HC reactor was replaced at two consecutive turnarounds (2008 and 2010). This paper will describe an initiative at ORYX GTL to i) prolong the operating lifetime of the catalyst, ii) regenerate catalyst and iii) the re-use of regenerated catalyst. Based on real plant data, this initiative was implemented in the recent turnaround in February 2013; only two catalyst beds were replaced with the remaining kept unchanged. In future turnarounds, HC catalyst replacement strategy is based on employing a combination of fresh, regenerated and multi-campaign catalyst. Applying this proposal will reduce operating cost by millions of dollars over the next 20 years and save the environment from a significant amount of dumped spent catalyst. Detailed paper will discuss the operating data and measures used to estimate the catalyst performance. Economic improvements and environmental impacts plots are illustrated together with graphical display of the catalyst replacement roadmap.', ' Alumina supported CoMo has been mainly used for commercial hydrodesulfurizarion (HDS) catalysts. On the other hand, since HDS activity per unit surface area of titania catalyst is significantly high, the potential of titania was noticed as carrier for HDS catalyst. But the tatania catalyst had not been industrialized, because it had been technically difficult to boost the specific surface area of the catalyst to the same level as that of alumina catalyst. Under such situation, we had developed a first generation titania supported CoMo catalyst (titania catalyst), which had high specific surface area by using original preparation technology. The first generation titania catalyst had not only high HDS activity, but also high selectivity of the denitrogenation reaction, moreover, hydrogen amounts consumed in the process was smaller in comparison with the alumina catalysts. However, the material cost and compact bulk density of the first generation titania catalyst was higher than the conventional alumina catalysts, therefore, it had not been commercialized. Based on the technology of the first generation titania catalyst, we have successfully developed a hybrid titania catalyst by combining the advantages of titania and alumina carriers. Shortcomings of the first generation titania catalyst were successfully overcome by the hybrid titania catalyst, which also exhibited a more drastic improvement in the HDS ? activity. We have already industrialized the production of the hybrid titania catalyst and established the supply system. We are going to install it into a commercial HDS unit in a certain refinery in Japan as a first commercial run of this catalyst, and the production of sulfur-free diesel oil from mixture of straight run gas oil and FCC-LCO will be started in 2014. The hybrid titania catalyst is applicable to HDS processes with a feed of kerosene, thermal clacked oil, vacuum gas oil as well as diesel oil.

', 'The Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) process has undergone a long evolution of hardware and catalyst changes from bed cracking with amorphous catalyst to short contact time riser cracking with sophisticated zeolite catalyst systems. Improvements to the process have provided a wide degree of flexibility to selectively target production of distillates, gasoline or propylene from VGO and residue feeds thereby making the FCC the most widely used conversion process. More generally, the objective of the process is to produce high valued products including fuels and petrochemicals such as light olefins and aromatics. Worldwide propylene demand is set to increase and outpace the growth rate of ethylene. This market development will apply considerable pressure on refiners and olefin producers and cannot be ignored. Traditionally, propylene is a byproduct from on purpose ethylene production, especially steam crackers. In the Middle East most steam crackers using ethane as a feed causes a heavily ethylene centered imbalance in this region. In order to address the general lack of propylene from steam crackers, on purpose propylene production technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation, metathesis or High Severity FCC have been developed recently. An alliance comprising of JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. (JX), Saudi Aramco and King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals has developed the HS-FCC process which is able to produce around 20 wt % of propylene by converting heavy hydrocarbon feedstock under severe FCC conditions, using a novel downflow reactor system. A 3,000 BPSD HS-FCC semi-commercial plant has been operated at the JX Mizushima Refinery in Japan since May 2011. Combined light olefins (C2-C4) yields of 30 to 40 wt% have been demonstrated with 16 to 19 wt% propylene yields for several feedstocks including hydrotreated residue. HS-FCC product portfolio can be further increased towards propylene and aromatics by further downstream conversion of its less desired products, using proven technology approaches.', 'Ethene and propene are two major feedstocks in the petrochemical industry. Traditionally, they are produced via the steam cracking process from e.g., naphtha. Since a couple of years, the demand for propene is growing faster than that for ethene. Hence, alternative (so-called on-purpose) processes have been developed for the production of propene independently from ethene. Among them are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), the metathesis of ethene with butenes, propane dehydrogenation and the methanol-to-propylene (MTP) route. The direct conversion of ethene to propene would be a more desirable route, because ethene cannot only be obtained from crude oil as feedstock (after steam cracking). Other sources are shale gas and natural gas (after dehydrogenation of ethane), as well as from coal via syngas and from biomass via bioethanol. This contribution focuses on the conversion of ethene over zeolites with different pore architectures, density of acid sites and size of the zeolite crystallites. The aim behind this systematic study was to explore the factors which govern the yield/selectivity of propene/butenes from ethene and to optimize the catalyst properties for this reaction. One major result of these investigations is that medium pore zeolites with a one-dimensional channel system offer catalytic properties superior to the well-known ZSM-5 zeolite. For example selectivities to propene of 43 % and to butenes of 24 % could be achieved over zeolite HZSM-23 as catalyst. Detailed experimental results will be presented in the full contribution and discussed in the light of the zeolite properties.', 'The distinguishing feature of the commercial FCC Unit\xa0A is a high potential for the reactor throughput, which determines a catalyst-to-feed ratio of 4.5. During the special selection, a series of cracking catalysts with the stepwise reduced REO content and increased zeolite Y quality and quantity have maintained a high gasoline yield, as well as high yields of olefins C3 and C4, when the average daily load was steadily increased by 20\xa0% and catalyst-to-feed ratio reduced to 4.6 from initial value. Enhancement of the FCC Unit A capacity led to the development of catalysts with reduced REO content and increased quantity or quality of zeolite component in the sample for the purpose of maintaining basic product yields at low catalyst-to-feed ratio without considerable reconstruction of the unit equipment. Decrease the REO content could be balanced by the increased zeolite content in the catalyst. Therefore, the stability of active zeolite as well as zeolite matrix durability start to play a dominating role. When choosing a catalyst for the catalytic cracking , i t is crucial to consider the catalyst-to-feed ratio, conditioned by the design of the unit. By defining the interrelation of catalyst-to-feed ratio and catalyst properties the use of existing equipment can be effectively maximized. For the development of FCC catalysts without REO it is necessary to carry out a set of studies on special modification of Y zeolite. The report also describes the commercial experience of the replacement of cracking catalyst with catalyst containing significantly reduced amount of REO (0.1\xa0wt%).', 'The worldwide refining industry has principally focused on the refining of medium, sour and light, sweet crude oils. Conventional crude oil reserves, with these properties, are steadily depleting around the world. In the nearest future, many operators will be required to use higher proportions of heavy crude oils and residue feedstocks in their refinery crude diet while meeting the growing demand for light clean fuel products. For many refineries, the traditional approach is to utilize delayed coking technologies for processing of heavy vacuum residues followed by hydrocracking or FCC to produce additional middle distillates or gasoline. It is now possible to completely convert these residues into light clean fuels through improved residue hydroprocessing using advanced catalysts. To process such heavy crude oil (tar, atmospheric and vacuum residues of heavy viscous oils, bituminous oils, natural bitumen, etc) TIPS RAS and CLG have co-developed a hydroconversion process using a specially synthesized ultrafine catalyst. This new technology is based on a fundamentally new approach to catalyst synthesis. The main feature of this approach is the abandonment of traditional solid catalysts in favor of a process to slurry the active metal directly into the oil. The process is carried out in hydrogen atmosphere at reaction zone pressure of 6.0-8.0MPa, hydrogen flow rate of about 1.5-3.5%wt per feedstock. Feed space velocity is 0.5-2 h -1 . Conversion is at least 92-95 %wt of feedstock to light fractions (gas, gasoline, diesel fractions and vacuum distillate). Catalyst consumption is also very low and does not exceed 0.01wt%. The process gives no waste, is non-sensitive to impurities and provides almost complete conversion of heavy crudes with a high content of metals, asphaltenes, resins, nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds to light and middle distillates. At the same time the production of the concentrate of valuable metals contained in the initial feed (V, Ni) and thermal energy is performed. Furthermore, the combination of residue hydroconversion with integrated hydrotreating or hydrocracking utilizing the LC-FINING reaction and recovery platform minimizes implementation risk and produces high-quality EURO –V fuel products. The hydroconversion process can effectively fit into any refinery schemes to maximize the production of fuels, petrochemicals and base oils.', 'Naphtha, a light hydrocarbon feedstock is generally used for the production of gasoline range hydrocarbons through conversion processes assisted by heterogeneous catalysts. The increased demand for middle distillate range hydrocarbons recently encourages the conversion of gasoline into middle distillates. Hence, the direct conversion of naphtha into middle distillate range hydrocarbons rather than to gasoline range hydrocarbons is of high industrial value and energy saving, where catalyst development plays a pivotal role. The olefinic feed based production of poly diesel and alkyl diesel are reported in recent years, but the direct conversion of paraffins to higher hydrocarbons falling in middle distillate range fuels is not reported so far. Here we demonstrate for the first time a single reactor, single catalyst, one step process operating on a bi-metallic bi-functional solid acid catalyst Pt-Sn/ZSM-5 for the direct conversion of naphtha mixed feedstock as well as n-heptane model compound into middle distillate range hydrocarbons through a cracking-based oligomerization reaction (Scheme 1) that provides alternative reaction path for the otherwise difficult reaction steps of paraffin dehydrogenation and olefin oligomerization in a single reactor system. At a typical reaction conditions of 673 K, 15 bar pressure the product exhibits 15-23wt.% yield to middle distillate along with considerable amount of gasoline LPG and H 2 (Fig 1). The net hydrogen production resulted from the joining of the shorter hydrocarbons and the dehydrocyclization of intermediate oligomer species adds additional value to the process for industrial applications. Direct conversion of naphtha to middle distillate range hydrocarbons through carbon number increase is possible in a in a single step catalytic process along with the formation of gasoline, LPG and hydrogen that makes the process valuable and energy efficient to operate in a single step conversion.', 'Propylene demand is projected to increase at an annual average growth rate of 2.9% per year during 2015-2025. In view of the recent trend of significant capacity build up of gas based thermal crackers, the need for propylene production from alternative sources is likely to gain momentum. On the other hand, owing to the continually deteriorating quality of crude in terms of residue yield and declining demand of fuel oil, the quantity of residue necessitating upgradation to lighter products will be an increasing trend. As of now, delayed coking is the most widely practiced process for residue upgradation, but owing to its lower margin caused by high coke yield along with lower coke price, refiners are looking for an alternate process with a better unit margin. These trends are also expected to result in generation of surplus low value naphtha. A new catalytic process has been developed addressing the above scenario where by both heavy feed and light feed are cracked with maximization of yields of light olefins, especially propylene. The process employs a precisely designed catalyst composition for simultaneously cracking lighter and heavier feed streams in a single unit, comprising two reactors connected to a single regenerator, for efficient heat integration. The process offers flexibility of processing heavy feed having conradson carbon residue (CCR) up to 11 wt%, without the requirement of a catalyst cooler. Light feed reactor acts as a heat sink and operates at very high temperature, which facilitates processing of a wide range of naphtha and gas streams. The synergy between the two reactors and catalyst brings the propylene yield as high as 24 wt% & 14% in the light feed and heavy feed reactors respectively. This process has the potential to provide a solution to various challenges in the emerging scenario and likely to bridge the gap in integration of refinery and petrochemical complex.', 'With increasing global demand for high value-added petroleum products, heavy oil upgrading technologies have been improved over the two decades. Moreover, heavy fuel oil demand in Japan is rapidly decreasing for some reasons such as switching fuel of choice for power generation from oil to gas. To meet the heavy fuel oil demand, some countermeasures are considered. The RDS (Atmospheric Resid Hydrodesulfurization unit)/RFCC (Resid Fluidized Catalytic Cracking unit) integration, the most popular integration in Japan, provides more naphtha and gasoline, less fuel oil, meeting the changing market demand for individual products. On this point, a key technology for residual oil upgrading is to utilize RDS unit. The feedstock of RDS unit is the crude unit bottom oil (AR), containing approximately 3-4wt% of sulfur. A main product is the low sulfur fuel oil, and by-products are desulfurized naphtha and gas oil. Loaded RDS catalysts are gradually deactivated with increasing temperature to meet the sulfur target, so it is necessary to replace the catalysts every year. As the deactivation rate is also related to the charge rates, and feedstock properties, if these factors are lower than planned, catalyst temperature does not reach maximum reactor temperature even at the end of run (EOR). To meet the catalyst life as planned, the utilization of RDS catalyst in general are at high severity operation conditions, with blending vacuum residue (VR), and so on. In this paper, the pros and cons of these cases are described based on the commercial plant data. From these results, it was concluded that high severity operation conditions and blending VR are beneficial for the utilization of RDS catalyst. To do so, some performance should be carefully taken into account, such as deactivation rate, maldistribution developing to HOT SPOT, and change in RFCC conversion depending on RDS operation period.', 'The unit of isobutane alkylation with butylenes exists in almost every modern refinery for production of the isoparaffinic mixture (alkylate) – an ecologically clean high-octane gasoline component. Traditional alkylation technology using concentrated sulfuric acid or hydrofluoric acid catalysts leads to extremely serious environmental and operational problems. Due to success in hydrocarbon conversion on solid acids catalysis, the conditions to develop the low-waste and environmentally friendly alkylation process appeared. However this process hasn’t been implemented yet at the industrial scale mainly because of peculiarities of alternative catalysts. They have high initial activity in alkylation but deactivate rapidly because of olefin oligomerization. Therefore, maintenance of alternative catalysts stability remains an important unsolved issue. A new competitive technology of alkylation using solid ALKILRAN catalyst was developed at TIPS RAS. Its principal difference is that a considerable increase in stability of catalysts is attained via organization of a special supply of a vapor–liquid feed mixture, which was called alkylation in the structured mode (ASM). This method makes it possible to achieve high productivity and to substantially simplify production technology even for typical solid acids. The properties and stability of our catalysts were studied in 0.01, 1, and 1000 dm 3 reactors, and the optimal catalyst choice allowed us to more exactly ascertain the role of each scaling level. Last reactor design was practically identical to the industrial one. The catalyst operated in a stable mode for 30 h, the olefins conversion was practically total, the alkylate yield was 90-100%, the conditions were optimal. The engineering development of the process was implemented, and the technological package was made for basic engineering of a new alkylation plant. Profitability of a new technology is more than twice higher than that of sulfuric acid alkylation with a similar productivity.', 'Nowadays the importance of heavy residue upgrading is obvious. A new concept has recently been introduced to oil industry that is based on nano-dispersion of catalyst as active metals without any catalyst supports. This new concept has much more flexibilities on feed contaminants like heavy metals, sulfur and asphaltene and the overall conversion for heavy residues (API Different diameters, 5-15- 30 and 50 cm, are used to determine Residence Time Distribution (RTD) of a pulse tracer. Ethylene glycol is used as tracer and refractive index is measured to follow the tracer and the results are modeled by n-mixed and ?-mixed model. ?-mixed model is based on n-mixed reactor in which the last reactor is not necessarily the same size of other reactors. The relevant equations are in full paper. Experimental data in four mentioned diameters are compared to models predictions. All figures are in the full paper.', 'In this study modification of H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst and application of SAPO-34 catalyst in conversion of methanol to gasoline (MTG) was investigated. The HZSM-5 was treated with Na 2 CO 3 0.1M solution for at 75 ? . The alkali treatment decreased the Si/Al ratio of the sample. NH 3 -TPD was applied to determine the total acidity of modified HZSM-5 showing that a large amount of Al presented in the sample had no effects on catalyst acidity. The XRD patterns showed that alkali treatment did not alter the crystallinity of the catalyst. The surface area (BET analysis) increased from 350 to 361 m 2 /g as a consequence of desilication process, and N 2 -adsorption/desorption isotherms showed that mesopores generated in the modified HZSM-5 catalyst. The SEM pictures showed that the alkali treatment has no visually detectable change in general morphology of the catalyst. The conversion of methanol to gasoline carried out over dual bed catalysts: SAPO-34 and modified HZSM-5. The SAPO-34 bed was used to convert the methanol to olefin (MTO) in 350 ? and the modified HZSM-5 was applied to conversion of olefins and also unconverted methanol to hydrocarbons at 400 ? . The reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed tubular reactor under ambient pressure and WHSV of 28 h -1 . Both the desilication of the catalyst and application of dual bed catalysts exhibited great improvements in catalyst conversion, catalyst life time, selectivity to C 5 + hydrocarbons and yield of gasoline rang products. In this reactor system the yield of gasoline cut (C 5 + ) products was improved relative to conventional systems.\xa0', '', '', '', 'Based on the composition of renewable natural lipids, the hydroprocessing technology for producing Bio-jet fuel from lipids was developed by SINOPEC Research Institute of Petroleum Processing. On pilot plant, the synthesized paraffinic kerosene was produced from various plant oil, waste cooking oil and algae oil. From 2011 to 2012, on the industrial demonstration plant of SINOPEC Hangzhou Refinery, the synthesized paraffinic kerosene was successively produced from palm oil and waste cooking oil. The quality of synthesized paraffinic kerosene produced by SINOPEC Bio-jet fuel technology meets all requirements of specification for synthesized paraffinic kerosene from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (ASTM D7566-11). The quality of Bio-jet fuel with blend ratio of 50% by volume synthesized paraffinic kerosene and the conventional jet fuel fulfils the requirements of Specification ASTM D1655. The SINOPEC Bio-jet fuel was successfully completed test flight in the April 24, 2013.', 'A.V. Chistyakov, F.A. Yandieva, A.E. Gekhman, I.I. Moiseev The paper presents the results of studies on direct catalytic conversion of primary biomass products into hydrocarbon fuels components. Ethanol, 2-methylpropanol-1, 3-methylbutanol-1, mixture of fermentation organic products, glycerol, rapeseed oil and wood cellulose were used as a feed. With the use of industrial and laboratory catalysts original approaches to the selective conversion of bio-substrates into alkanes, olefins, aromatics and naphthenic hydrocarbons components of gasoline and diesel fractions were elaborated. It was found that the novel reaction of hydrocarbon skeleton cross-condensation of ethanol combined with another bio alcohols, glycerol and acetone into hydrocarbons makes it possible to substantially extend the range of renewable raw materials for fuels production. The mechanistic aspects of bio-substrates conversion and evolution of catalytic active cites are discussed.', 'Lignocellulosic biomass-derived fast pyrolysis oils are potential second-generation bio-fuels towards the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon foot print. In the present work an experimental investigations on co-processing of fast pyrolysis oil-derived tar fraction with vacuum gas oil (VGO) in an advanced cracking evaluation (ACE-R) unit is carried out to convert them into refinery FCC product slate hydrocarbons with different blending ratios (5:95, 10:90, 15:95 and 20:80). The cracking patterns have been compared with the VGO catalytic cracking at catalyst-to-oil ratio (C/O) ratio of 5 with industrially available equilibrium fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (ECAT). The bubbling fluidized bed pyrolyzer, facility at CSIR-IIP, is used to produce fast pyrolysis oil with jatropha cake as a feedstock at 500–530 0C temperature and atmospheric pressure. The results of co-processing studies indicated that the yields of crude naphtha and light cycle oil (LCO) is increased from 28 to 34 wt.% and 15 to 20 wt.%, respectively; whereas the yields of dry gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is decreased from 2.1 to 1.4 wt.% and 38 to 23 wt.%, respectively, with the increase of blending ratio from 5 to 20 wt.%. Furthermore, the yield of heavy cycle oil (HCO) increased with increase in the blending ratio of fast pyrolysis oil due to its higher oxygen content, which leads to limit the higher blending ratio. The coke yield has been found to be lower in case of fast pyrolysis oil-derived tar fraction co-processing as compared to VGO processing in FCC unit. It has been observed that the yield of LPG is higher in case of co-processing at lower blending ratios as compared to the VGO cracking. Therefore, it can be concluded that the co-processing of fast pyrolysis oil-derived tar fraction with VGO in FCC unit would be possible at lower blending ratios upto 5 wt.%.', 'Biobutanol is second generation alcohol fuel with a higher energy density and lower volatility vs. ethanol. However, butanol toxicity to the fermenting microorganisms limits its concentration in the fermentation broth, resulting in low butanol yields and a high cost for butanol recovery from the dilute solutions. For this reason biobutanol production is successful only when this process is coupled to the technology of effective product recovery for the removal of inhibitory products. Here in TIPS we have been developing thermopervaporation (TPV) approaches for the removal of biobutanol from fermentation broths since 2009. Pervaporation is known to be the membrane technique which provides selective separation of organics from water by evaporation through the dense hydrophobic membranes, and this approach is considered to be the most promising separation technology for the recovery and partial concentration of butanol from the ABE fermentation broth. The TPV is the variant of pervaporation in which permeate is condensed on the cold surface just in the membrane module at the atmospheric pressure. Thermopervaporation pilot setup was designed. The corresponding membrane surface area for the pilot-scale TPV module is 336 cm 2 , and easily can be scale up to 1 m 2 . TPV separation of the multicomponent model fermentation mixture makes it possible to increase the concentration of butanol - from 1 to 20 wt. %; for ethanol - from 0.15 to 0.74 wt. %; for acetone - from 0.45 to 1.7 wt. %. In this case, acetic and butyric acids are partially rejected by the membrane. In the TPV mode of butanol recovery from model fermentation mixtures, the permeate flux exceeds 1 kg/(m 2 h) (comparable with industrial pervaporation processes) at the atmospheric pressure and at a condensation temperature of 10° ? .', 'The city of Campos dos Goytacazes – located on the north of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,is the main beneficiary from the country´s petroleum government take in Brazil, perceiving more than 80% of the amount destined to cities. Until 2010, Campos also held the second largest area for sugarcane crops in Brazil. However, Campos’ sugar cane industry has been facing a strong retreat since the 1970s, due to the lack of investment on research and new technologies coupled with a weak inter-organizational cooperation. On the other hand, the strong reliance of Campos on the O&G revenues results in an economy based on a finite resource; a low level of economic diversity; and the atrophy of a historically sound economic sector. Hence, this study evaluates the potential for the development of sugarcane bagasse-based biorefineries for the production of high valued bioPlatform Molecules (bPMs). Different schemes of distilleries were simulated aiming at estimating the potential production of Levulinic and Succinic Acids, which are valuable inputs to pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and solvents synthesis. The distilleries schemes vary from replacing the expansion valve by a turbo expander to a highly modern industrial facility including: turboexpander, high-pressure boilers (100 bar), and electromechanical devices. The selected platforms are produced by acid hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse followed by fermentation of the hydrolysate. Results showed that the production of high valued bPMs from sugarcane bagasse can contribute to the competitiveness of sugarcane industry. Likewise, considering its multiplying effect, the facility can also act as a driving force for the economy of the region.', 'Fast & rapid depletion of conventional fossil oil reserves, increase in oil prices, concern over global environmental impacts along with uncertainty of energy supplies, prompted scientists to search for alternative sustainable and eco-friendly energy sources & technologies. Currently, 90% of hydrogen is produced by the reactions of natural gas or light oil fractions with steam at high temperatures, coal gasification and electrolysis of water, which are highly energy intensive. Biological hydrogen production processes are considered as the most environmentally-benign. An innovative way for Biohydrogen production is utilizing natural dark fermentative organisms and anaerobic fermentation process and is deemed to be a new sustainable biofuel technology. Dark fermentative Biohydrogen production is possible from different carbon based feed stocks like starch, sucrose, glucose, xylose, molasses etc. as this process produces hydrogen at a faster rate without any requirement of light energy source. This requires screening and selection of effective bacterial strains. A series of batch tests were conducted to determine the effective carbon source to use as substrate, appropriate nutrient solution and also to find the optimum values of pH, temperature, substrate concentration for Biohydrogen production by developed consortia. The lab scale studies in 10 litre bioreactor indicated that a consortium of two bacterial strains i.e. Clostridial butyricum and Clostridium bifermentans gave the highest Biohydrogen yield of 2-2.4 mole H2/ mole of glucose vis-à-vis a theoretical yield of 4 mole H2/mole of glucose which is considered to be an significant research accomplishment. This research work also threw light on the conversion of sugars into volatile fatty acids (VFAs) which limits the total Biohydrogen yield. Overall, the work acts as a pathway for further research in microbial processes for achieving higher Biohydrogen yields and also demonstrates that Biohydrogen from dark fermentation would be a promising sustainable biofuel technology.', 'A novel integrated system for a stable and large-scale cellulosic bioethanol supply from herbaceous energy crops has been developed. This new ethanol production process is made by combining several novel technologies containing dry ammonia pre-treatment process, saccharification by self-made enzymes, membrane system for enzyme recycling and sugar concentration, and ethanol fermentation using non-genetically modified yeast. For low-cost, year-round supply of biomass as a raw material, Napier grass as herbaceous energy crop was selected and its cultivation, harvest, and storage system were developed. A low-cost, high-yield (over 50 t/ha) cultivation and supply system for Napier grass was established. Dry ammonia pretreatment is shown to be able to cleave chemical bonds between lignin and hemicellulose and to induce higher-order structural changes in the cellulose of solid biomass. These effects are suggested to accelerate enzymatic saccharification on the following process and improve the yield of monosaccharides. This pretreatment required no water medium, so it could be an environmentally-friendly process since it produces no waste water. Research on cellulase (i.e. screening and improvement of cellulase for hydrolysis of ammonia-pretreated biomass) was conducted and novel low-cost cellulase cocktails have been developed. Then, a cellulase recycling and sugar concentration system using membrane separation technologies is investigated to optimize the overall process and reduce the production cost of cellulosic ethanol. We have achieved high yield (over 80% of raw material charged) and highly concentrated sugar solution (up to 20%). For increasing ethanol yield we have employed novel non-genetically modified yeast because C5 sugars such as xylose are difficultly fermented by commonly used brewer’s yeast. We then got cellulosic ethanol from both C5 and C6 sugars in high yield (over 90%). Using non-genetically yeast enabled waste yeast to be returned to land in a safe and reliable manner. Furthermore, the overall system achieves adequate greenhouse gas reduction and life cycle fossil energy ratio. The results are delivered from the collaborative research with the University of Tokyo, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Mechatronics Systems, Ltd., Toyota Motor Corporation, Kajima Corporation, Sapporo Engineering Ltd. and Toray Industries, Inc., sponsored by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).', 'A biorefinery is a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce bio-based products (food, feed, chemicals, materials) and bioenergy (biofuels, power and/or heat). The main challenge is to achieve the sustainable processing of biomass which includes economic sustainability, close to zero emission and positive energy balance. Traditional biorefineries based on specific biomass could not yet reach the sustainable processing of biomass which includes all above mentioned factors. For example despite a positive energy balance, Sugarcane based biorefineries produced different types of negative environmental impacts, such as CO 2 due to fermentation processes for first and second generation bioethanol, CO 2 due to bagasse or lignin combustion processes. The Algal biorefineries presents the negative energy balance with relation to consumption/production close to 2 which is far from sustainable from an energy point of view. The authors proposed the strategy to achieve sustainability of green integrated biorefinery based on optimal design of multicomponent feedstock and biorefinery topology. On one hand with energy and material integration of Sugarcane and Multi Species Algae biorefineries, it is possible to approach a zero emission system due to CO 2 (produced in fermentation and combustion processes) sequestration in phototrophic algae cultivation systems, and vinasse utilization in algal mixotrophic systems, and a positive energy balance due to utilization of energy stored in sugarcane bagasse or lignin in an integrated topology. On the other hand, the integrated biorefinery takes advantage of numerous components in multicomponent feedstock, producing several low-volume, but high-value, chemical biochemical or biological products, increasing the general profitability and assuring the economic sustainability. The PSE, Process Integration, LCA, exergy and economic analysis tools were applied at all steps of integrated biorefinery design, integration and evaluation for selected case study and allowing significant reductions of CO 2 and vinasse emissions and improve global energy balance.', 'Bio-oil from ligno-cellulosic biomass as second generation bio-fuel-source offers advantages over first generation bio-fuels due to its sustainability without invoking food vs. fuel debate in the midst of growing concerns for mitigation of global warming and diversification of global energy basket. Owing to challenges in direct use of bio-oil as fuel, one of the prudent areas of focus globally, is alternate bio-oil utilization routes by development of robust catalyst and viable carbon dioxide neutral green technology for catalytic steam reforming (SR) of bio-oil to produce hydrogen that presents itself as a clean renewable fuel and potential futuristic bio-fuel contender. The present paper critically reviews catalysis reported in literature for hydrogen production by steam reforming of bio-oil with a series of different active reforming catalysts. Some with noble & non-noble metals on supports or with modifiers and enhancers, to improve the performance of the catalyst with reduced catalyst deactivation; which in turn gives higher bio-oil reforming run time on stream. Varied reaction pathways and reaction products distribution as a function of different reaction variables are reported in view of greater hydrogen conversion, yield and selectivity. For enhanced insight of this reforming technology for hydrogen production as an alternate future energy option, due emphasis is endeavored to elaborate different novel bio-oil reforming techniques. These include catalytic electrochemical, spouted bed, auto thermal, molecular beam mass spectrometer-interfaced reforming etc. Innovative modifications in conventional fixed and fluidized catalytic bed reforming reactor set ups and modified feeding systems employed for overcoming challenges in using different bio-oils are summarized. Study of this technology aims to establish that bio-oil reforming can be a promising pathway for producing hydrogen using renewable ligno-cellulosic sources.\xa0', 'Brazil is the current global leader in the use of ethanol as a fuel source wherein their blend in Gasoline has been increased to as high as 40%. Acknowledging ethanol use as a major move towards renewable fuels and benefitting the environment as well as supplementing the fossil fuels, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) has incorporated a new Biofuels company (HPCL Biofuels Limited) which is first of its kind in India to meet the mandate of 5 to 10% ethanol blend in fuel. The two bioethanol plants set-up by HPCL Biofuels Limited in the State of Bihar uses the state of the art technology for ensuring optimum output, lowest energy & input consumptions. The plants have the latest cane diffuser technology for achieving higher juice extraction & low power consumption. Modern technologies such as continuous fermentation, multi pressure distillation & molecule sieves are used for producing bioethanol for blending in fuels. Evaporation technology is used to reduce the spent wash generation by about 70% in order to reduce pollution. Bio-methanation plant is installed for reducing BOD / COD levels & generating biogas for use as a fuel as well as for bio-compost. The bio-compost fertilizer thus produced is sold to farmers in the command area thus ensuring zero effluent discharge. The recent trends show that the demand for ethanol is continuously increasing in India on account of growth of user industries and use for mandated fuel blending. This makes India the fourth largest producer of bioethanol in the world after Brazil, the United States of America (USA) and China, producing approximately 2000 million litres of bioethanol, mainly by fermentation of sugarcane molasses.', 'Introduction Colombia is 28th economy in the word and third largest in South America. The high sun radiation levels and rich water resources in Colombia are important factors for the competitive production of biofuels based on crops such as sugarcane, sugar beets, cassava, African palm and other natural feedstocks. These crops can be harvested all year, thanks to the country’s climatic conditions. Colombia is the 5-th producer of palm oil, 7-th producer of sugarcane and 12-th producer of ethanol in the world. Currently, Colombia produces bioethanol from sugarcane and biodiesel from palm oil. Sugar mills and palm oil producers have the most organized and developed producer associations and scientific research centers. Biofuels legislation in Colombia is based on Low 693 of 2001 (bioethanol) and Low 939 of 2004 (biodiesel). Bioethanol production from sugar cane started in late 2005 and palm oil biodiesel production in late 2007. Colombia’s blending requirements are for 8 percent ethanol for gasoline and 8.5 percent biodiesel for diesel. The country has a high potential to increase the biofuels production, taking advantage of its natural resources and its capacity to extend the existent crops for biomass production without any deforestation. The perspective of biofuels in Colombia is promissory thanks to the government intervention creating the appropriate legislation to promote its production. Nevertheless, if the biofuels production goals would be accomplished, Colombia will become\xa0 a bioethanol exporter and one of the Latin-American countries leader in the development of systems to produce energy from clean and environmentally friendly sources. An analysis of biofuels modern trends and future needs, with basis in the existent legislation and including some aspects such as the sustainable development, energy balances, environmental impacts, use of renewable resources and social impact, was made in this work.', 'Bioethanol produced from non-edible plant feedstock is the one of the most perspective alternative energy sources. Efficient methods of lignocellulose feedstock pretreatment are necessary to enhance economic efficiency of the bioethanol production. Ionic liquids (hereafter ILs) are quite novel, promising reagents for plant feedstock pretreatment. However, some disadvantages of the traditionally applied ILs, namely relatively high melting points and viscosities, decrease their cellulose solubilizing ability. Therefore we have investigated the correlation between the properties of ILs and their structure, synthesized ILs and applied the compounds obtained for lignocellulosic feedstock pretreatment. To accomplish this, we have investigated two main methods of ILs synthesis: the quaternization reaction and anion exchange (metathesis). A number of ILs based on tetraalkylammonium cations and 1,3-dialkylimidazolium was obtained. The synthesis of substituted imidazoles by Van Leusen (initial reagents for quaternization) was also conducted. The advantage of this method is the possibility of obtaining practically any 1,3- and 1,3,5-substituted imidazoles. The structure of the compounds obtained were confirmed by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, the melting points of the majority of ILs were experimentally determined. The influence of the cations and anions structure on the ILs ability to dissolve cellulose was empirically established. As compared with the traditional ILs (alkyl-substituted imidazolium chlorides) ILs containing cations with hindered bulky radicals (benzyl) and/or iodide and acetate anions have reduced viscosities and melting points leading to the increasing cellulose solubility in those compounds. ILs containing hydroxyl groups or oxygen atoms as part of the radicals of imidazoilum ring don’t have the ability to solve cellulose. The comparison of the pretreatment efficiency of the ILs obtained [BzMIm]Cl and the most studied one [BMIm]Cl was conducted. The results showed the superiority of synthesized compound on a number of parameters, namely better solvent power in relation to cellulose and lower melting point.', 'Iran has discovered a considerable amount of oil and gas reserves at its territory in the Caspian Sea. The reserves are estimated to contain about 10 billion barrels of crude oil and 50 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. After some exploration studies, Iran may start production from the said resources. In this article, after reviewing the petroleum activities of the Caspian Sea region, some conceptual approaches have been made on production, refining, and distribution of the above reserves as follows: –It is estimated that priority will be given to the four Iranian coastal provinces at the Caspian Sea to be fed from the above sources. Therefore, an oil and gas refinery will be constructed at one of these states. –In case of higher oil production rates, the excess extracted oil may be sent to Tehran and Tabriz refineries for supplying to other parts of Iran. –Ultimately, the surplus of higher rate will be available for export. However, construction of a large terminal including an oil & gas refinery and a petrochemical complex at the Caspian Sea coast is proposed for all activities. The environment impact of the said changes shall also briefly be described. Author: Farrokh Kamali, Advisor at Iran LNG Company (ILC), Iran', 'Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), a Government of India undertaking under Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas is a fortune 500 company. It operates petroleum product cross country pipelines of total length of 2600 Km across India. The cross country pipeline is laid underground at a depth of about 1.5 m to 2.0 m from natural ground level. BPCL cross country pipeline passes through different terrain like forest, barren land, farm land, urban area, river and sea etc. and there is no dedicated utility corridor provided to petroleum pipeline. BPCL is required to carry out pipeline surveillance and security to check the health of the pipeline like any encroachment on pipeline route, any sabotage on pipeline, any leak on pipeline and condition of ROU (Right of Use) of pipeline route. The traditional system was to deploy 1 pipeline surveillance personnel for every 8-10 Km length of pipeline who is required to walk on the pipeline. We have deployed about 400 personnel who walk on the pipeline, monitor and report any abnormality. There was no system in place to measure their performance and monitor pipeline surveillance work. Since the pipeline spreads in different parts on country and is difficult to even reach in some places on a regular basis by officers. The Pipeline is underground throughout and carrying highly inflammable & hazardous petroleum products at very high pressure. Any pilferage or leak in the pipeline may lead to environment as well as human hazard. Though Night Patrolling Vehicle (NPV) crew consisting of an armed security guard, a supervisor and vehicle with driver is deployed to check the highly vulnerable areas of pipeline for any pilferage/sabotage attempts on pipeline in night hours, we have the daunting task to check actual performance of pipeline surveillance system. Due to inadequate checks & measures there was a rise in petroleum product pilferage incidences on the pipeline. BPCL pioneered to use the latest digital technology along with traditional systems to check, monitor and measure pipeline surveillance systems to reduce the pilferage incidences and avoid any major disastrous situations on the pipeline. After the successful implementation of GPS based ROU monitoring of BPCL pipelines, it was further improved to make use of this modern technology to link surveillance personnel performance to their monthly wage/salary payment on line. Necessary programs were developed in the system for the automatic calculation of performance grades of each personnel deployed for surveillance work and it is verified by the BPCL officer considering actual site conditions. This data then gets converted to a monthly attendance sheet which then automatically transfers to the payment gateway of the Security agency and then to the bank account of the surveillance personnel for the payment. The GPS system has provided monitoring of pipeline surveillance system performance on a real time basis without visiting the site. It has increased reliability of monitoring systems & reduced the pilferage incidents to great extent thus increasing the pipeline throughput and safety. Also the payment of the services were prompt and with proper reports. It has brought in lot of discipline in the system and people are accountable for the jobs carried out by them. Payment is made based on actual performance measured by system .', 'Russia is the world&#39;s largest supplier of crude oil and oil products to Europe, Asia and the USA. Currently, there is a significant increase in the volume of oil and oil products, provided mainly by the tanker fleet, modernization of old and construction of new oil-loading tanker terminals. More than 10 new marine oil terminals for loading of oil and petroleum products were built during the last 10 years, such as in Primorsk, Koz&#39;mino, Taman, and the 4th terminal in Ust-Luga, etc. All these terminals belong to different oil companies: Transneft, LukOil, Tamanneftegaz, SibirPortEnergo, Rosneftebunker, Gazprom Neft, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, and others. The geography of these terminals is very wide spread: Ust-Luga and Primorsk are located in Baltic Sea, Novorossiysk, Tuapse and Taman is in Black Sea, Varandey is in Barents Sea; New Port is in Kara Sea; oil-loading port Koz&#39;mino is in Pacific Ocean. The pollution of the environment in the marine areas grows when oil pipelines rupture due to hydraulic wave shocks that may occur if the entrance valves at shore facilities, or at the tankers\xa0 shut off. That is why all the oil-loading piers in Russia are equipped with systems of protection from the hydraulic shock. Different terminals use different techniques of loading tankers - pumping load (as in terminal in Ust-Luga and Taman), gravity flow (as in Novorossiysk and Koz&#39;mino), or loading of petroleum product that goes directly from the shore tanks. Ocean terminals also differ in various ways of processing tankers by piers as well as by properties of transferred liquids: the loading conditions of liquefied gases are very different from the loading of crude oil. For each particular product, the tanker terminal must use its own optimal method of loading and hence its own protection system. This report describes a theory and methods for calculation of parameters in protection systems of tanker terminals and their interface from hydraulic shock waves, illustrated by numerous examples from the Russian oil industry practices. This report also introduces an experience of the authors in the area of selecting protection systems for oil-loading tanker terminals and factors required for determining the composition of the safety equipment.', 'Economic history over the last 300 years has shown that efficient transport methods and a choice of transport options stimulate economic growth and commercial opportunities. Ship-to-ship (STS) transfer of bulk oils and gases is a well-established procedure worldwide. It offers the ability to optimise transport costs by the use of large tankers transshipping to and from smaller tankers, for delivery to, or from, end users or production facilities. STS transfer at sea eliminates the need to use costly port infrastructure and transports oil and gas in a safe, efficient and cost effective way, although in port transfer can be done using existing facilities. The use of STS transfer should be considered when evaluating transportation options from new production facilities. It has a role to play in developing production from smaller or difficult to access fields. STS transfer offers flexibility in trading and can create new trading as well as employment opportunities. Regional hub points for STS transfer can be established at strategic locations at minimal costs to meet trading needs. Strategically located STS transfer hubs can reduce voyage time, in turn saving bunker costs. As well as saving storage costs in oil distribution and storage centres for example Singapore. As older, inefficient and environmentally challenged refineries close, the pace of change in trading patterns of oil and its products will accelerate and STS transfer will play a vital role.', 'Natural gas substitutes from renewable sources (renewable gases), such as methane rich gas from the microbiological degradation of biomass, or hydrogen produced by electrical energy surplus from wind farms, are mixed into the natural gas infrastructure within the European Union. Although these renewable gases currently play a minor role, it is politically desired that their yearly production will increase significantly, in Germany alone to 10 billion m 3 /a (353 billion ft 3 /a) by 2030. The renewable gases can contain significant amounts of oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen which is not present in natural gas, and also bacteria. While for the gas transport, net little effect is anticipated, renewable gases may have a detrimental impact on underground gas storages (UGS) with regard to: - reservoir rock (formation damage) - subsurface installations (corrosion) - gas treatment (corrosion, processing) UGS are a vital part of the European natural gas infrastructure. In Germany their capacity is more than 20% of the annual national natural gas consumption and the need for storage capacity is strongly increasing in Germany and the European Union. To evaluate the potential risks from renewable gases on UGS, literature studies have been initiated by UGS operators such as the German RWE Dea AG, which operates UGS facilities with a total storage volume of nearly 1.9 billion m 3 . All major results of the individual studies will be presented. Particularly interesting is the potential effect hydrogen on the bacteria activity in UGS. Although hydrogen can be an excellent feedstock for bacteria, it is of no concern for pure hydrogen gas storage because of the lack of a carbon source needed for any bacteria growth. In town gas storages, which contain like natural gas / hydrogen mixtures and utilizable carbon source, severe effects were observed because of bacteria activity such as loss of hydrogen and increased reservoir temperature.', ' With the pace of underground gas storage construction being accelerated in China, more attention is focused on the economic and safe operation of gas storage facilities. A systematic investigation of hazard factors and risk assessment is very important for ensuring safe operation of gas storage. In this paper, underground salt cavern gas storage was selected as the research object, and ranked into three assessment units, including underground facilities ? surface plant facilities and surface gathering pipeline. The eight hazards that could contribute to the facility risk, include corrosion, erosion, hydrate formation, equipment failure, operation related, mechanical damage, geologic effects and natural forces, are analyzed by integrated analysis approach. A fault tree approach was used to assess the risk for the underground facilities, a quantitative risk assessment method based on API581 was used to assess the surface plant facilities, and a risk indexing method was used to assess the gathering lines. As an example, the risk assessment of an underground salt cavern for gas storage has been carried out, and the risk assessment results provide scientific evidence for safety management of the gas storage. ', 'Crude oil is pumped at the rate 14,200 bbl/d from Faras field to Badr field (58 meter higher in elevation) at western desert in Egypt through 6 inch x 34.2 miles pipeline using two identical pumps connected in series, working at best overall pumping efficiency. A one megawatt diesel engine is used to generate the necessary power for motors to run the two pumps. This paper presents economic analysis for impact of using a Drag Reducing Agent (DRA) in the reduction cost of oil pumping, keeping the same pumping flow rate where one of the two pumps is temporary abundant. DRA could reduce pumping discharge pressure by decreasing Hydraulic Friction Losses (HFL) through the pipeline. Economic analysis is applied for the two pumping cases; case-1) using two pumps without DRA & case-2) using only one pump with DRA. Items of such analysis are: 1) Cost of the consumed diesel amounts in both cases. 2) Total cost of DRA including daily rental rate of injection skid, daily hiring rate for operators and price of used DRA in gallon per hour. 3) Cost of pumps and their maintenance over pipeline service life. Contribution of this paper is that HFL is calculated in both pumping cases by knowing measured Pump Discharge Pressure (PDP) and differential head between initial and final flowing points (DZ), from which 52 % reduction is achieved in case-2 which is confirmed by considering daily consumption of diesel in both cases and by knowing efficiencies of diesel engine & pump and diesel calorific value (converted to energy unit) could calculate pump hydraulic power then Total Dynamic Head (TDH) is determined by knowing pumping flow rate, accordingly PDP is concluded (found close to the measured values) by knowing pump suction pressure. Based on, HFL is calculated as TDH minus DZ. It&#39;s concluded that Using DRA realized annual saving of 0.6 million dollars on pumping crude oil.', 'Drag reducing additives (DRA) are used to increase pipeline capacities which has been widely used throughout the world in both crude and petroleum products pipelines. Performance tests have been carried out in the crude oil pipeline traversing from sea port to refinery. Modern types of DRA which is a powder product emulsified with a polymer content of about 30-35% when compared to traditional gel based product with a polymer content of about 5-15%. This paper describes several performance tests conducted on the DRA injection, to find the most optimal injection of DRA. It proposes a method to measure drag efficiency as a function of line fill and shows the relationship between injection rate of DRA and parameters like flow rate, pressure gradient and the load on the pumps. DRA utilization has led to significant reduction in energy consumption in the range of 5-30%, By-pass operations of intermediate pump stations and increase in throughput in order of 10-30%. Experiments and results obtained were obtained with and without By- pass operations and savings were deliberated. DRA’s used in the experiments are different types of emulsions with different carrier oil. Performance tests include the variation of specific gravities of carrier oil on the performance of DRA. Experiments were conducted with different dosing rates and with different pumping capacities. Problems encountered in pumping units and prime movers during dosing of DRA were discussed. Effects of subsoil temperature and viscosity of crude oil transported were also analyzed. The results obtained are analyzed with the different parameters affecting the flow rate and drag reduction. Results are compared with numerical method calculations and numerical models have been generated. Cost benefit analysis of DRA and economics of transporting the crude oil with DRA dosage was analyzed and discussed.', 'Controlling corrosion is one the biggest challenges in the oil and gas industry, with vast expanses of pipelines and metal surfaces exposed to harsh temperatures and processing environments. Newly developed corrosion monitoring technologies are leveraging a unique combination of science and electronics to keep the threat of corrosion at bay. A new ultrasonic spot sensor which can be permanently attached to piping and vessels at temperatures up to 600º C (1100º F) was developed recently. This revolutionary device is wireless-enabled and has a resolution capable of detecting small changes (±0.1mm) in wall thickness due to corrosion. Once installed, repeated measurements can be taken without access. The sensor is particularly well-suited for areas of the plant that are difficult to access by inspection personnel. The technology has been commercialized and sensors have been installed in refineries globally and select upstream facilities. While the spot corrosion monitors are ideally suited to detect and monitor general, uniform corrosion, sensors to detect non-uniform, localized corrosion such as pitting are also needed. The matrix array sensors in development involve advanced electronics utilizing sophisticated ultrasonic techniques like sparse and phased arrays to detect, visualize and quantify localized corrosion. Multiple dry coupled and direct deposited thin film sensor types are required to address all of the corrosion damage mechanisms present in the oil and gas industry. Permanently installed sensors and precision thickness mapping using scanning devices can provide early warning of unexpected corrosion events, before leaks occur. The deployment of advanced corrosion sensor technology is helping to improve the safety and integrity of our manufacturing facilities by changing the way we approach corrosion management.', '\xa0 Scientific research and design institute for oil and gas development,Russia,Ufa The recent years have seen a steady increase in the volumes of sour oil and gas condensates produced in Russia. Such hydrocarbons contain highly corrosive, toxic H 2 S and low-molecular-weight mercaptans that pose a number of technical and environmental challenges during their production, treatment, transportation, storage and processing. The standard known in Russia as GOST ? 51858-2002 places stringent requirements on the concentrations of H 2 S and mercaptans in the commercial oil, thus highlighting the need for more effective in-field sweetening technologies, to be implemented by all companies producing sour oil and gas condensates. We have developed a number of new reagents to remove H 2 S and mercaptans from the oil stream, as well as an improved technology for their production and application. More targeted studies have been conducted for the first time ever to examine the fundamental processes underlying H 2 S stripping technologies based on the use of organic compounds derived from reactions between formaldehyde and alkyl-and oxyalkylamines. The studies revealed that scavengers based on primary mono-, polyamines and formaldehyde, as well as on formaldehyde with monoethanolamine, include an active agent: oxygen- and nitrogen-containing organic compounds characterized by a cyclic structure of 1,3,5- dioxazines. An increase was identified in the yield of 1,3,5- dioxazines, as the amines base weakens. These findings help to select amines to synthesize new reagents and to forecast their efficiency as an H 2 S neutralizer. Basic principles have been developed for a combined oil treatment process designed to remove H 2 S in two steps: a physical treatment (by vacuum treatment or gas stripping) to strip out most of the H 2 S, followed by a chemical treatment using a reagent to neutralize residual H 2 S. Therefore the advantages of the combined technology over a purely chemical method are that operational costs are appreciably reduced by 3.1 times with the pre-vacuuming technology and 2.8 times with the preliminary gas stripping technology. Furthermore, chemical reagents consumption rate is also reduced by about 3-5 times.', 'In Europe’s mature market, refiners have to face decreasing margins, growing fuel grade variety due to non-harmonised bio-quotas, and expected increase in fuels spec limitations. Therefore, reductions in quality give-aways and decrease in product inventory help to support the overall refining profitability. The inventory reduction comes along with the need to increase the flexibility in blending the final fuel from different intermediate streams. Today, this flexibility is achieved by in-line blending and just-in-time production. The final fuel composition is optimised in real-time and quality is determined using on-line analysers. These analysers are based on direct determination of specific physical properties, separation techniques (e.g. chromatography), and optical methods deriving multiple fuel parameters at once by chemometrical models. Nevertheless, there is still room to improve. Optical methods like infrared spectroscopy deliver information about hydrocarbon classes but insufficient data about carbon distribution - chromatography delivers the opposite facts. A sufficient fuel property prediction bases on both, hydrocarbon distribution and classes. Some analytical technologies offer access to both information. But these technologies require additional highly skilled people as well as increased investments and costs. The basic idea for improving the fuel blending process even further is utilising existing technologies by combining them in an intelligent way. The combination of infrared spectroscopy and chromatography - which are both standard equipment in refineries - increase the accuracy of fuel property prediction for each blend feedstock. Even the fuel blend models can be refined, subsequently. An improvement in fuel property predictions and of blend mixing rules is the preconditions for minimising quality give-aways and increase just in time production flexibility to reduce inventory.', '', '', '', 'With ageing of the equipments, the efficiency of existing plant decreases with time. In LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) plant, decreased efficiency is demonstrated through reduced products yield or less throughput. However, often there exists some opportunities to address this problem by minimizing pressure drop across piping and control valves which facilitates higher recovery of heavier hydrocarbons (C 3 + components) from the rich gas for production of VAP (Value Added Products) such as LPG and Naphtha. In the present case study described in this paper, one of the opportunities was identified and recommended for improving efficiency of the existing LPG-I & LPG-II plants in terms of improved throughput and also effectively capturing the C 3 + heavier hydrocarbons from the rich feed gas by suitable debottlenecking. The combined processing capacity of these plants is 11.3 MMSCMD. The outlet lean gas as second stage vapor (SSV) from LPG-II is routed through an 18” header which joins the lean gas of SSV of LPG-I and combined SSV is routed downstream through a 20” header for further processing. Pressure drop issue in the combined header was identified & addressed in the present case study through suitable modifications in the pipe sizing. Thus the detailed analysis of the existing system provided the scope for further improvement through a cost effective scheme with CAPEX of INR 3.01 Crores ( 0.5 Million USD) , enabling LPG plants to operate at higher pressure resulting in increased throughput of 12 MMSMCD. The equivalent gain in value added products is around 173 TPD. The estimated pay back period is around 15 days. This case study demonstrates the hidden opportunities in an existing LPG plant for valorization of natural gas liquids from rich gas which resulted in additional LPG and Naphtha production.', 'The topic of the Collaborative EU-Project NEXT-GTL was the production of liquid fuels from natural gas. Novel and innovative routes were explored. Besides non-conventional routes for catalytic syngas formation including membranes and direct catalytic conversion of methane to methanol, it encompassed the conversion of methane to aromatics followed by upgrading of the products by alkylation with ethane/propane. The aim of the upgrading discussed in this contribution was to avoid the toxicity of benzene as liquid fuel and to increase the research octane number (RON) by producing primarily ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene and cumene as products of the alkylation reaction. Experiments were performed in a flow-type reactor at a pressure of approximately 6.5 bar, a temperature of 350 °C and a reactant stream composed of ethane, propane and benzene (molar ratio about 8 : 4.5 : 1). The catalyst with the best performance was found to be the bifunctional zeolite catalyst 1.7Pt-H-ZSM-5 (n Si /n Al = 35). The reaction yielded at least 35 wt.-% of alkylaromatics after 5 h on stream. The mixture had a RON of at least 105. The RON was calculated by multiplying the molar fraction of each compound in the liquid phase with the corresponding blending RON value of the pure compound and adding the results to the final blending RON. After 70 h on stream, the yield of alkylaromatics was around 24 wt.-% with a RON of 103. The catalyst could be regenerated in hydrogen, and the long-term performance was reproduced after regeneration.', 'The demand for the processes of natural, associated, refinery gases and their components (ethane, propane, butane) transformation into olefins, grows very quickly. So the development of such processes is very important. Dehydrogenation of light alkanes (C 2 –C 4 ) presents a significant problem associated with their low reactivity, the high temperature of the processes, and low selectivity. Oxidative dehydrogenation allows one to decrease the temperature of this process significantly. The integration of selective permeable membranes into catalytic reactors makes it possible to overcome thermodynamic restrictions of the dehydrogenation process due to selective hydrogen removal, as well as to ensure the controlled introduction of the alkane and oxidizing agent into the reactor. This increases the efficiency of both non-oxidative and oxidative alkane dehydrogenation. The use of membrane reactors in the case of the oxidative dehydrogenation also enhances the safety of the process due to separate supply of the hydrocarbon and oxidant onto different sides of the membrane. Progress in membrane catalytic technologies in recent decades takes place due to the use of new high technologies, primarily nanotechnology approaches. In the present paper, the application of these systems for production of light olefins from the corresponding paraffins is considered with the sample of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (EOD) and its mixtures with methane in different types of membrane reactors. It was shown that EOD realization in the membrane mode, with separated gas flows, allows one to use the gas mixtures with wide [ethane/O 2 ] ratios. The per-pass conversion of ethane in [ethane + O 2 ] mixtures can be increased up to 70% in the case of the operation mode combining membrane and flow processes, with selectivity being about 95%. It was demonstrated also that at the ODE of the methane and ethane (14.5%) mixture the ethane transformation efficiency does not depend on the presence of methane.', 'The availability of traditional base chemicals such as ethylene, propylene and BTX aromatics is undergoing dramatic changes due to the global shift from liquid to gaseous feedstocks, fuelled by the abundance of unconventional feedstocks. Although this trend is primarily triggered by the fast growing shale gas economy in the US and cheap coal in China, other regions will follow, causing the global supply and demand situation to equilibrate across the regions. On top of the effect from lack of aromatics in the product from ethane steam cracking, BTX markets will be hit by lower demand for gasoline in key regions and consequently less aromatics-rich reformate from refineries. The tightening of aromatics markets will come at a time of healthy growth rates, however. Advantaged gaseous feedstocks such methane from shale gas or coal gasification as well as natural gas liquids (NGL), primarily propane and butanes from shale reserves or associated petroleum gas (APG), offer a great platform to make aromatics in a unconventional manner, and close the supply- demand gap, especially in regions where naphtha is in short supply. Historically, aromatization of short-chain paraffins and olefins has been used to produce aromatics-rich gasoline but it is currently being re-discovered as an attractive process for BTX aromatics, and ultimately paraxylene. Like many other processes for aromatics conversion and upgrading, aromatization makes use of the unique properties of zeolites. For C3 and C4 paraffinic feeds, Ga-MFI (ZSM-5) with Ga being incorporated in the zeolite framework has proven to be indispensable when it comes to achieving high conversion and selectivity to aromatics. The industrial record of making aromatics from synthesis gas and methanol conversion is also confined to gasoline so far (MTG process) but methanol-to-aromatics (MTA) as an aromatics-selective derivative of this process has the potential for a break-through in low-cost feed scenarios. Methanol from natural gas can be used to methylate toluene to make mixed xylenes or predominantly paraxylene, depending on the process type. All unconventional aromatics processes fit well into existing schemes of conventional aromatics production. This paper provides an overview on the technologies used in the production of BTX aromatics from conventional (reformate, pyrolysis gasoline) and unconventional (gas-based) feeds, and elaborates on the potential benefits from alternative aromatics technologies.', 'Recovery of natural gas liquids (NGL) from natural gas is quite common in natural gas processing and can provide significant economicbenefits. There are several methods for NGL recovery while among them turbo-expander technology is recognized as a powerful option for the recovery of liquids of natural gas, especially ethane and heavier alkanes.The recovery of ethane from natural gas is considered to be more economically feasible due to shift in ethane prices and advances in process modifications. However, with careful process selection for retrofitting of old plants, increasing about 30% or more is happening as a result and in many cases recovery efficiency can also be improved significantly too. In this study, process design and retrofitting of ethane recovery technologies are reviewed. A viable process design for the production of ethane using Persian natural gas as feedstock in Gachsaran is proposed.The plant capacity determined 19×10 3 MMSCFper year with 92.4% ethane recovery. The process design and retrofitting are performed using Hysys simulation software. The simulation results show that the ethane recovery and methane recovery are near 92.4 and 98.2%, respectively while in a base case, the plant capacity is8.5×10 3 MMSCFper year with ethane and methane recovery of 83.3 and 94.9 %, respectively. In this study it is shown that there are some important limitations for direct application of GSP simulation, such as feedstock water content, which can be an obstacle for process efficiency. The results of this retrofitting for the case study show that, the feed stream locations and column temperature (about -150ºC), and tower pressure (22.5 bar),stream split ratio (30%) in Tee, are very important parameters to achieve the optimum ethane recovery.', 'Alkylation is one of the important operations in the petroleum refinery industry and it is well known that isobutene/butane system in the presence of strong acids (HF) leads to the formation of alkylates, which are excellent blending components for gasoline. There is an alternate route for the synthesis of alkylate, by alkylation of light naphtha (C5-C6) with lighter olefins (C2-C3), which are available surplus quantities in refinery streams and cannot directly be added to gasoline pool because of its low RON and high RVP. On the other hand, the drawbacks associated with liquid acid/solid acid catalyzed alkylation processes, such as operational and disposal of liquid acid, rapid deactivation of the solid acid catalyst are major problems for commercialization. Catalyst stability and alkylate selectivity are major issues in these processes. With an objective to overcome these limitations, an attempt was made to design a suitable catalyst using ab-inito DFT methods. The key reaction mechanism involves rapid protonation of olefin to form sec-carbonium ion followed by hydride transfer process of isoalkane to form n-alkane and tert-carbonium ion. The resulting tert-butyl carbonium ion reacts rapidly with olefin to produce alkylate, side reactions may lead to heavy hydro carbon build-up, leading to blocking of catalyst pores and acid sites. In present study, DFT calculation methodology involved finding out transition states for various reactions to obtain key parameters such as reactive sites, surface properties to design suitable catalyst. Simulation studies showed that, hydride transfer is limiting step for obtaining better alkylate yield, in case of Isopentane(C5)/propene(C3) and isohexane/ethylene systems on tungstated zirconia catalyst surface. Study indicated that olefin is rapidly protonated to form sec-butyl carbonium ion than oligomerisation intermediate. The formation of oligomer transition state requires higher activation energy on tungstated modified zirconia catalyst surface while thermodynamic free energy (?Gfo) calculations favored the alkylation process.', 'Due to the emergence of Natural gas for power generation in the Indian Refineries, the light naphtha utilization towards power generation and in MS pool, has decreased significantly thereby increasing its availability in surplus. Thus, the value addition to the refinery would be valorizing the light naphtha stream through isomerization and aromatization. The isomerization route produces branched paraffins with higher octane. Well practiced commercial processes are available for isomerization. Aromatization of light naphtha stream produces BTX. However, the isomerization of the light naphtha fraction rich in C5 stream is difficult as the suitability of the product to the MS pool may be of concern. Aromatics are also produced in the refinery by reforming. The naphthene rich feedstock is converted to aromatics over platinum-based catalysts. Thus, there are limitations for converting the light cuts (especially C5-rich stream) to aromatics. The alternative route is conversion of these light cuts to aromatics. The challenge for this technology is to decrease the dry gas production particularly methane and ethane and have tunable selectivities for B and T-X fractions. The aromatics thus produced could be used as the blending component for the MS and also could be used as a high-valued petrochemical feedstock. Currently, there is no commercial process for the light naphtha (C5-rich) aromatization in practice. The process could be optimized as per the market/refinery requirements to meet the product specifications. Thus, the selectivity to the desired product could be tailored by the appropriate choice of the catalyst promoters and modifications. In this paper, the results on the non-noble metal based catalysts for light naphtha aromatization are discussed. The catalysts are modified and tailored to achieve high selectivities to produce either of the BTX fractions. The catalyst screening and detailed optimization of the reaction/process parameters are carried out in the lab-scale micro reactor unit. The light naphtha conversion of >90% was achieved with > 50 % selectivity to aromatics.', 'A wet gas remains as gas during the whole course of decline in reservoir pressure. No liquid is formed in the reservoir as the pressure path does not enter the phase envelope. On the other hand, separator conditions lie within the phase envelope, resulting in some liquid drop out. For pressure drop calculation it is essential to employ gas viscosity in both porous media and tubing. The governing equation for fluid flow through porous media is Darcy law, in which pressure drop is proportional to reciprocal of viscosity. Moreover, proper size of tubing is estimated by summation of frictional, gravitational and acceleration pressure drop which are a direct function of gas viscosity. Numerous correlation have appeared in literature to estimate gas viscosity, but these correlations have limited range of use and can be applied for specific range of data. Gas viscosity correlations are divided into two categories according to method of calculation, pressure division and pressure differential. Gas viscosity data from 10 wet gas fields which covered a pressure range from 2360 to 7720 psia, temperature range of 142 to 267 Degrees Fahrenheit are collected. By using this data base and pressure division method (pressure divided by dew point pressure) a new correlation is developed and optimized. The new correlation has an average relative deviation (ARD) of -0.17% and average absolute deviation (AAD) of 2.35%. For resemblance purposes, its accuracy compared with existing methods and as a result, it is concluded that the new correlation outperforms the existing correlations in the literature.', 'NGL (LPG, Motor Sprit, Kerosene and High Speed Diesel) and Ethane from Natural Gas Production aims to meet the present Energy crisis by more than 50% and Flourish Petrochemical Industries in Bangladesh. After recovery, higher Hydrocarbons produced from Natural Gas, have Gas flow pressures that will not decrease in Winter Season. In production systems, higher hydrocarbons (liquid hydrocarbons) normally allowed 2 gallon per mmscf, but now after gas processing more than 100 gallon per mmscf is present in Natural Gas pipeline (sales gas).Most of the gas fields in Bangladesh are using dehydration plants like Silica Gel and Glycol for water and condensate removal from the gas stream in production systems, causing a loss of higher hydrocarbons in this system. Only four out of twenty-two gas fields contain adequate amounts of ethane ranging from 1.77% to 4.57% of the gas composition. Installation of Molecular Sieve Turbo-Expander (MSTE) plant in production systems may recover Ethane. After cracking into ethylene, it may be used as raw material in Petrochemical Industries and LPG may be used as fuel gas.

Australia and the US followed with first projects. Commercially driven by the price differential between petroleum products and natural gas prices as well as clean air politics today small-to mid-scale LNG is at the verge of establishing sizable operations in many geographies and - even though a very minor part of petroleum products are being substituted - forming a future multibillion dollar global market for operators, wholesalers, equipment and plant suppliers. Compared with the global, world-scale LNG business small scale business is a local and regional affair. LNG is produced in small or mid-scale LNG plants or world scale bulk loads are broken into smaller parcels. Different from world scale LNG where large cargoes are handled and evaporated into national pipeline systems, small-scale LNG relies on further cryogenic distribution such as coastal LNG carriers, trucks and eventually in the near future rail cars and river barges. Typically LNG is stored locally and on-board near the point of use. This paper after laying out the main regional demand and supply side trends for small-to-mid-scale LNG describes and illustrates key technology elements of the small-scale LNG chain and introduces examples of successful small-to mid-scale LNG developments.', 'Natural Gas Liquefaction plants are being considered for a wider range of climates, including arctic environments. This paper compares several liquefaction processes including Propane Pre-cooled Mixed Refrigerant (C3MR) and Dual Mixed Refrigerant (DMR) cycles, focusing on the differences in performance in cold climates, and sensitivity to both seasonal and diurnal temperature variations. The interaction between the choice of cooling medium (air or water) and liquefaction cycle is also explored, and various rotating equipment options, including electric motor drive, aeroderivative gas turbines and refrigerant compressor arrangements are examined. Case studies are included to describe practical solutions. The complex interplay of all these factors and their relation to project objectives is described in order to provide a basic understanding of the considerations needed to select the optimum liquefaction cycle, refrigeration driver type, and machinery configuration for a specific opportunity.', 'Ship to Ship transfer of LNG has proven to be one of the key technical challenges of the industry. The ability to transfer ship to ship efficiently is an enabler for a number of commercial LNG activities including FSRU, LNG Bunkering, Break Bulk LNG and Small Scale LNG operations. Methods of transfer do exist however these have limitations in areas such as functionality, operating envelope, maintainability and reliability. In 2011, Shell Shipping Technology engaged the services of Houlder Ltd, a company with substantial experience in marine and offshore lifting and transfer equipment, to work with Shell Shipping Technology to develop a transfer solution. This paper presents the development of the Marine Hose Manipulator (MHM) which utilises the flexibility offered by composite hoses and the functionality of a traditional Marine Loading Arm to provide safe, reliable, LNG transfer between floating facilities and assets. The MHM provides an alternative to traditional hard piped Marine Loading Arms (MLA) and can accommodate extended operational envelopes between two dissimilar sized floating bodies. The basis for the conceptual development was to provide a permanent transfer system that is self contained and modular solution, which can be integrated to an existing LNG carrier (LNGC) with minimal interface requirements. The system was also required to provide an operating range that ensures compatibility with standard range of worldwide trading LNGCs as well as much smaller coastal vessels. The MHM offers flexibility to accommodate a broad operational range, has a compact footprint, lower weight, and offers good operability and maintainability, whilst providing similar functionality to what would be expected from a MLA. The paper describes the steps taken, challenges faced in taking the system from concept, through testing and qualification to reality.', '"Oceanic gas hydrates have received much attention because the global estimate of methane gas in these hydrates is 2-10 times larger than the ultimate recoverable resources of conventional natural gas. Especially, the gas hydrates in offshore Japan is expected to be a valuable domestic resource. Toward its development the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry (METI) launched a ""Japan’s Methane Hydrate R&D Program"" in 2001 and currently the research stage has been in progress to the implementation of the first offshore production test. In our research so far, we established the methodology to delineate gas-hydrate concentrated zones and found more than ten hydrate-concentrated areas in the eastern Nankai Trough, which were estimated to bear gas hydrates equivalent to approximately 0.57 trillion m 3 (20 tcf) of methane gas in place. To evaluate gas-hydrate well productivity and production technology, the first offshore production test was conducted in the waters off the coasts of Atusmi and Shima peninsulas in March 2013. One production well and two monitoring wells were completed in gas-hydrate-bearing turbidite sands at a depth of approximately 300 m below the sea-floor in about 1000 m of water. Gas production was obtained easily upon depressurization using an electric submersible pump (ESP) with gravel pack completion. We succeeded in about six-day continuous gas production of up to about 120 ,000 m 3 (4.2 mmcf) for an average rate of 20,000 m 3 /d (706 mcf/d). The reservoir response and environmental impact during the gas production test is now under analysis, but it is safe to say that this world’s first offshore production test opened the door of commercial production from offshore hydrates. This paper gives an overview of Japan’s R&D activities and technical problems to be overcome toward future commercial production from gas hydrates."', 'A new calculation formula for sloshing height of LNG tank subjected to seismic excitation was proposed by using numerical computation method A new calculation formula for sloshing height of LNG tank subjected to seismic excitation, was proposed by using numerical computation method and multiparameter fitting methods. First, the seismic response of integral tank structure was analyzed by virtue of a finite element method. In the finite element model, a type of liquid element was employed to simulate LNG in the tank. The result with the liquid element would produce much more accuracy than using boundary element, which was widely used in previous studies. Based on response spectrum modal analysis, the impulsive and convective modes of LNG acting on the inner tank under seismic oscillation were analyzed by fluid-structure interaction technology, and the sloshing height was determined from the displacement results of convective mode. After investigating the characteristics of the present calculation formula for sloshing height, the four parameters of tank inner diameter, LNG height, the maximum earthquake affecting factor and earthquake characteristic period were chosen for parameter sensitivity analysis on sloshing height. Based on the influence rule of the four parameters, a new calculation formula for sloshing height was established by multiparameter fitting method. There is only one expression in the formula, and the parameters in the expression can be determined at the design primary stage, which can simplify the sloshing height calculation and facilitate the engineering design of LNG tank largely.', '"Russia takes a special place with regard to natural gas (NG) resources and volumes of its extraction. Chemical processing of natural gas offers\xa0 prospects of a step-by-step transition from raw materials export to the export of products of deeper processing. This will provide a powerful start to the development of Russian innovative economy. Among the most promising approaches to chemical NG processing are the synthesis of hydrocarbons through methanol developed by the leading Western companies (the MTG process offered by ExxonMobil which allows to synthesize from synthesis gas a mix of liquid hydrocarbons with structure close to gasoline and the synthesis of light olefins elaborated by UOP, Norsk Hydro and Lurgi). The method of obtaining hydrocarbons from natural gas is highly relevant for Russia possessing a third of world reserves of natural gas. The paper compares technologies for producing light olefins from synthesis gas through methanol and/or dimethyl ether (DME) developed by Western companies with the technology developed by Topchiev Institute of Petrochmiecal Synthesis, Russian AScademy of Sciences (IPS RAS) to synthesize olefins from synthesis gas through dimethyl ether via one stage. The advantages of said method are reduction of the thermal effect at the stage of olefin synthesis from DME. The designed catalyst allows to carry out synthesis of light olefins from pure DME with a yield equally high to that achieved in commercial ""methanol"" processes at a lower temperature using a more stable catalyst. TIPS RAS has developed the technology of highly selective synthesis of gasoline range hydrocarbons from CO and H 2 through oxygenates (DME and methanol) which is similar to Haldor Topsoe TIGAS which uses synthesis gas with H 2 /CO = 1. Advantages of the method offered by TIPS RAS are that synthesis gas of practically any composition can be used and high conversion of synthesis gas per pass can be achieved; therefore, the flow of the recycle gas and capital costs can be reduced. Another benefit of this technology is that it is flexibile in terms of the final product with respect to characteristics and needs of a particular oil field for certain processing products based on their consumption on premises and transport possibilities."', 'The traditional NGL recovery process with a scrub column cooled byPropane refrigerant has operated successfully to rejected C5 and heavierhydrocarbons from rich feed gas in many LNG plants.However, since the critical pressure of lean gas is low, the operatingcondition shall be different and the process scheme should have to bechanged from the rich feed gas processing. In this paper, the design considerations of NGL recovery for lean feedgas processing will be discussed. Reducing the operating pressure of scrub column to get enough distancefrom the critical pressure, a condenser of a scrub column requires lowertemperature than Propane refrigerant. A condenser shall be cooled by awarm bundle of Main Cryogenic Heat Exchanger (MCHE) and it leads toincrease the power requirement of cryogenic refrigerant circuit.Besides, when the pressure in MCHE becomes lower, it needs morecryogenic refrigeration power to produce LNG. Auto-refrigeration process can also separate C2/C3 and heavierhydrocarbons condensed by lower temperature achieved by gas expansion.Auto-refrigeration process requires a residue gas compressor to recoverthe pressure after heavy hydrocarbons separation. However, once thepressure is recovered, any additional cryogenic refrigerant power maynot be required at MCHE. Since unsolved BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene & Xylenes) couldfreeze and may cause blockage under lower temperature, the concentrationof BTEX shall be controlled within its solubility range in the lowtemperature zone.The circulation of C2/C3/C4 can ensure the reflux rate and BTEX solution,if the feed gas composition is richer than the saturated composition in NGL recovery process. The contractor will propose an adequate NGL Recovery Process to fit forthe feed gas composition, the required LNG production rate and thepurpose of NGL recovery avoiding BTEX freezing.', 'The introduction of alternative fuel in the transport sector which is less pollutant, economically more affordable and more available, reduces air pollution while allowing economic and social development of Algeria. The purpose of this article is to highlight the environmental impact in terms of the greenhouse gas effect due to changes in the consumption of fuels in Algeria and evolution of fuel consumption in the transport sector within the year 2030 with the development of using Compressed natural gas (CNG). The presentation will include the means needed to be put in place, the quantities of fuel sold and the amount of CO 2 eq reduced to 2030 from the development of CNG use in Algeria.', 'LNG production capacity and LNG trade have rapidly grown over the past decade. ExxonMobil with its commercial and technology partnerships has built and developed more than 40% of this new global LNG supply, over that same decade. But ExxonMobil has been a part of a long history in LNG production dating back to the 1970s, beginning with the Marsa el Brega LNG Plant in Libya. The legacy continues with the planned 2014 start-up of the two-train, 6.9 MTA Papua New Guinea LNG Project. The global landscape of natural gas continues to evolve. Robust demand growth is forecast, whereby global consumption could increase by more than 60% by 2030, driven by growth in Asia-Pacific. On the supply side, unconventional gas (primarily in North America) and large gas finds off East Africa and in the eastern Mediterranean, and continued exploration success in Australia, are enabling more LNG volumes for export into the demand regions. As such, the need for LNG capacity growth to meet the forecast supply-demand balance is considerable, especially relative to the pace of capacity additions in the past. The challenges of cost of supply for these LNG projects will continue to drive technology enhancements across the entirety of the project. Cost of supply will also act as a control mechanism on the pace of development in regions with high labor costs, regulatory constraints, and socio-political obstacles for resource development. The key concept that underpins ExxonMobil’s successful growth in LNG is the importance of the full integrated value chain on improving delivery economics and cost of supply. The partnerships that developed the large trains (7.8 mtpa) in Qatar delivered this economy of scale across the entire value chain, from reservoir through liquefaction, shipping, and regasification. In addition to the deployment of technologies across the value chain in these recent projects, ExxonMobil has also developed various technology enhancements in its internal research programs. For instance, ExxonMobil’s Enhanced Mixed Refrigerant™ (EMR™) process is based on a dual mixed refrigerant cycle that offers the potential of scalability and expandability required to meet the needs of new capital projects. This process has the flexibility to accommodate a wide range of feed compositions and product specifications. Cost benefits are achieved via EMR™, not necessarily through economy of scale, but by a strategy of fostering broader competition in equipment supply. Recent ExxonMobil research has identified novel, non-flammable or low flammability refrigerants for use in mixed refrigerant and cascade liquefaction processes to reduce the cost and footprint of baseload plants (both floating and onshore).', 'Although Middle East has 43% of proven Gas reserves equivalent to 80 trillion cubic meters, of which 50 % are in the GCC, apart from the challenge of historic under-investment, the regional gas endowments have been highly uneven. Boosting gas supplies through a combination of E&P developments and imports is being done. Current 100 billion cubic meters (BCM) demand is expected to rise to 300 BCM by 2020 and 600 BCM by 2030. About 90% of incremental energy demand for Power would come from Gas. Investment will have to focus on creating large volumes of storage capacity as well as peak deliverability to cope with rising imports and power demands. Some of the favourable factors mainly are : 1. Only Qatar is an exporter of high significance. GCC represented 6% of global gas demand but held 22% of its reserves, which foreshadows difficulties in production, regional trade and pricing. 2. UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, plan to award contracts worth nearly $ 68 billion, during the next five years to raise gas production Currently, Dubai and Kuwait import LNG through floating storage and regasification units. Now, demand extends into all but the winter months and may soon be year round. Abu Dhabi is developing a 9 MMTPA project in the Emirate of Fujairah and Bahrain is developing a 3 MMPTA shore-based import facility for 2015, whereas Kuwait will increase capacity from 600 MMcf/d to 3 Bcf/d. Oman is looking to combine the Oman LNG and Qalhat LNG projects, besides developing unconventional gas and steps to reduce gas subsidies. Yemen also continues to export LNG but has experienced interruptions because of security issues. LNG remains a best choice for GCC due to : 1. Long term strategic supplies for growing fuel demand from Power Sector 2. Most environment-friendly and efficient option for Power 3. Techno-economics favouring future industrial fuel mix of LSFO and LNG 4. Refinery-Petrochemical integration becomes a more viable option 5. Abundant LNG supplies from several new sources and favorable logistics', 'The first LNG plant of the South Pacific, PERU LNG, was inaugurated in 2010, representing the biggest private investment in the history of Peru. The single-train, 4.4M tonnes a year processing plant uses APCI’s propane, pre-cooled mixed-component refrigerant process and gets the gas from the Camisea gas fields located in the jungle. The gas fields were discovered in the 80’s however it was not until 2004 that their production phase began thanks to the initiative of building an LNG plant. This would open Peru to international gas markets as local consumption was too small alone, for the fields to be developed. In its 4 years of operations, the plant will have loaded 190 cargoes with main destinations Spain (39%), Asia (30%) and Mexico (23%). Cargoes from Peru to Japan were critical during the 2011 Fukushima disaster where LNG demand from Japan dramatically increased. PERU LNG’s location is ideal for deliveries to the OPEC countries turning Peru into a key international player in the LNG business. This LNG project has changed the history of mega-projects in the country, through its lead in engineering and financial models, and environmental and social performance. In parallel the use of trucks to transport LNG to the remote areas of the country (virtual pipeline) in the future will allow remote cities to benefit from this fuel. The PERU LNG project has also contributed with the development of the national port system by introducing the latest technology in its facilities, which will in turn be a raw model for future marine projects in the country. The aim of this poster is to show how LNG projects are a main driver in local energy and upstream activities and how a country can turn into a key world player by introducing this kind of technology.', 'ORYX GTL, located in the State of Qatar, is the world’s first commercial sized Low Temperature Fischer-Tropsch GTL plant, using Sasol’s Slurry Phase Distillate (SPD) process. Inaugurated in 2006, it is a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and Sasol Synfuels International. ORYX GTL employs the Fischer-Tropsch process to convert Natural Gas into high value liquid products that are sold internationally as fuels and petrochemical feedstocks. Start-up challenges impacted the throughput of the plant during the first few years of operation. These challenges were in a large part due to a combination of scale-up, start-up and value engineering challenges which required considerable effort to overcome. Since 2011, significant improvements in operational and safety performance have been realised. World class safety performance has been achieved through the use of the “road to zero harm” campaign, and concurrently improvements in operational availability and production volumes have also been achieved. Start-up challenges that impacted the first few years of performance will be discussed along with the methods that were employed to overcome them. Current operational performance with historical trends demonstrating the considerable improvements will also be presented.', 'Shell’s involvement with gas-to-liquids has been a 40 year journey of technology and product innovation. Shell first established its pioneering natural gas-to-liquids (GTL) technology at a commercial scale in Malaysia in 1993. Ever since, the technology has played an increasingly important role in monetising large scale gas reserves. At the same time, GTL products such as kerosene, gasoil, naphtha and base oils have smoothly entered existing markets. Because of their excellent technical and environmental performance (e.g. virtually free of sulphur and aromatics) they can either be blended straight into existing supply chains and end-user applications or sold neat for specialised use and maximum local emissions reduction. This paper will focus on Shell’s 40-year GTL development journey and particularly on how Shell continues to innovate in order to maintain GTL as a competitive source of liquid oil products made from natural gas. It will discuss innovation at all scales and steps of the GTL process, with examples in areas such as catalyst development in FT fixed bed technology, gas treating through advanced analytical techniques and continuous development of high quality GTL products. It will feature various successful new applications of GTL products. The paper will also highlight the key challenges and opportunities for small to medium scale GTL plants that can play a vital role in unlocking smaller gas fields. Examples will be given of places with abundant natural gas resources where proven GTL technology – if applied in a nimble way – offers the potential to overcome factors which may currently impede field development, such as a lack of nearby natural gas markets and ensuing gas transport challenges – by locally or regionally turning the gas into high quality oil products.', 'The discovery of gas hydrates in a solid ice-like gas, appearing in most of the world&#39;s ocean floor has sparked an interest in the scientific community and government agencies dedicated to the investigation of natural resources, as well as oil exploration companies. The present study aims to describe a proposal of a viable operating model for safe removal of the Gas Hydrates through experimental methods designed to place Venezuela as a strategic energy power and contribute to the development of the nation. The research is descriptive, based on the recognition of Gas Hydrates in the continental margin of Venezuela, which have not been fully explored. The focus is to identify, understand and determine the importance of gas hydrates, identifying this resource on their shores, define the technical feasibility of its extraction, as well as the development of technology and extraction methods for Gas Hydrates in Venezuela. The contributions will be made: From methodological, allowing through the review and description, to explain the importance of gas hydrates; Technological, since you know about the possible methods of extracting gas hydrates; Social, and that will directly benefit the Venezuelan people expressed in the labor sector technical, administrative and development workers who will implement the project. Institutions such as PDVSA will position entity generating knowledge in basic and applied research, which places the country as a nation with a potential strategic energy to contribute to the overall development of the nation. It makes the statement of the activities undertaken, and the resources needed, to implement the project, as well as the findings of the feasibility of the proposal, which is expected to be favorable.', '', '', '"History has told us that no year in gas is ever the same as the previous or the next one. A golden age of gas can easily turn to stone (and back again) as a result of a sudden regional imbalance of supply and demand or a change in regulatory, economic or political conditions. This unpredictability reminds us that gas, unlike oil, is still far from being a global market, despite significant recent advances in LNG carriage and the completion of major transnational pipelines. The huge divergence in gas prices between the US and Japan particularly reflects this. In moving through these ""interesting times"" for gas, Russia and the Middle East have more in common than a casual observation might suggest. In a fascinating paper which draws upon his extensive experience of both gas markets, Ken McKellar, Deloitte&#39;s Middle East Energy & Resources Leader, will uncover these common interests and how they can best be developed for the benefit of both regions and the world at large."', 'The American shale gas revolution shows the world a new road for energy development. In the last few years, China also has paid ever increasing attention to shale gas development; however, circumstances between the US and China are quite different. At present, China has only several tens of shale exploration and appraisal wells, and does not have matured procedures for predicating shale gas resources, reserves and productions. In addition, shale gas geology in North America is very different from that in China, and we cannot simply transplant its shale gas exploration and development practices to China. Thus, our country cannot copy America’s shale gas development model, and form a large scale commercial development in a short period of time. To bring the shale gas resources into production, we need to adapt to our country’s situation, and realistically face the major challenges, i.e., the current recoverable resources and our understanding of the exploration and development (lack of core technologies), clean energy and environmental protection requirements, elevated attention from the government and imperfect policies for promoting and assisting, high costs and low gas prices etc. This paper discusses how to realize the shale gas development and the harmonic environmental progress through analyses of the major challenges and causes in shale gas resources and supplies in the country.', 'Renewable energies are energies that come from naturally occurring and theoretically inexhaustible sources of energy which are continually replenished and currently provide less than 14% of total primary energy in the world. While there is hope for renewables to get a higher share in the energy mix during future decades, we face severe challenges and doubts regarding the possibility of a ‘sustainable supply’ of energy by renewable sources. Renewable energy technologies are some of the fastest growing in the world but they are still not matured, are costly and complicated to develop. Environmental doubts come to mind when we expect renewable energies to resolve environmental concerns. Currently they do not eliminate greenhouse gas emissions and conventional air pollution, as manufacturing, transporting and operating them produce some emissions, consume water and disrupt land use and wildlife habitats. An increase in oil prices have a statistically positive impact on most renewable energy project returns but this means that the renewable energy sector is substantially more risky and dependent on oil and gas price fluctuations. Low oil prices and continual development of shale gas can speedily turn the renewable industry into quite a difficult financial position and even bankruptcy for private investors. Financial worries pursue when we observe for the first time in several years; 2012 saw a decline for global investment in renewable energy because of economic crisis as well as uncertainty over support policies in Europe and the US. Renewables still are quite reliant on government subsidies to survive. The past progress of renewable projects shows high dependency on government and private support in the form of giving subsidies or exemption from tax, put on other energy sources (such as carbon tax). So here a valid question is: In case shale gas proves to be plentiful, accessible and cheap, wouldn’t it be sensible to put much more money on CCS and energy efficiency projects than renewable energies to decrease the investment risks and also to meet environmental obligations of some western countries? This article seeks to help energy policy makers in governmental agencies or private, set forth\xa0 effective and practical approaches in securing energy supply, as well as preserving the environment by mobilizing their aid from low influential renewable energies toward higher yielding hydrocarbon technologies that can faster and better change the global energy portfolio into a cleaner and environmentally friendly supply. We evaluate the different risks, limiting factors and concerns which are currently inherent in development of renewables and discuss possible solutions, such as more investment in CCS and energy efficiency projects (in which OPEC and other producing countries could also participate to create a new energy dialogue with consuming countries), to minimize the level of risk associated with our future energy supply and toward a sustainable management of the energy market.', 'By most accounts, the vast shale gas reserves found throughout the world offer an unprecedented opportunity to meet growing energy demand in a cleaner and more sustainable manner. While the economic and energy security benefits of shale gas development could be substantial for many countries, the evolving environmental, social and regulatory responses to shale gas development continue to challenge the industry. As shale gas development continues to go global, there is likely to be continued scrutiny of how industry and governments are responding to the concerns raised. While there is a widely held view within the industry that shale gas resources can be developed in a safe and environmentally sound manner, the public and policy leaders in many regions remain skeptical. Since shale gas development is a global opportunity, there is a growing need to coordinate and share lessons learned and best practices on a global scale to ensure that the opportunity is not just limited to some areas of the world. Drawing on the most recent and authoritative studies, this presentation will address the key issues and concerns that have been raised pertaining to shale gas development, including challenges related to potential water contamination, disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, earthquakes, and greenhouse gas emissions. The results of recent investigations and studies will be discussed with a view towards assessing whether the global shale gas industry will earn what has been called the “social license to operate.”', 'Brazil is a natural gas importer with a market of nearly 100 MM m 3 /d. Of the total supply 30% comes from Bolivia and 20% from LNG. Natural gas production is mostly associated with the offshore oil production and performed by the state owned company Petrobras. Upward trends in the production of natural gas rely mainly on post-salt regions located offshore and far over 300 km from the coast. However, onshore unconventional gas resources, particularly shale gas ones, have a significant potential to increase the country´s natural gas supply. These resources are roughly estimated by Brazil´s Petroleum and Biofuels Regulatory Agency (ANP) to overcome 200 tcf, or about 7 times higher than current Brazilian total reserves. Onshore unconventional gas production has not started yet in the country. The current stage involves potential assessment by ANP and preparation for upcoming bid rounds by the end of 2013. For this unconventional gas production to reach the Brazilian market, adequate infrastructure in the country is needed. The resources are located far from gas pipelines but closer to electricity transmission lines. Other alternatives for the conversion of this additional natural gas supply include the use of it as a raw material for the chemical industry, mainly nitrogen fertilizer and methanol. It is worth noting that the Brazilian chemical industry deficit has reached US$ 25 billion in 2012, whereas nitrogen based-fertilizer intermediates accounted for one third of it. Currently, 60% of the Brazilian fertilizer market is supplied from imports, creating a high level of dependency on these products and letting the country be vulnerable to currency oscillation and supply shortages. Hence, this study aims at providing an overview of current status for unconventional gas in Brazil as well as an analysis of the main challenges to monetize these potential resources, based on a model to evaluate the break even prices.', 'A number of discoveries and observations have been obtained during the last decades - location of ultra-deep petroleum deposits, disagreement between identified biotic sources and proven hydrocarbon reserves for most of the supergiant oil and gas accumulations can find a proper interpretation in the framework of the theory of the abiogenic origin of hydrocarbons. According to this theory, hydrocarbon compounds could be generated in the asthenosphere due to the process of high-pressure synthesis, or in the deep crust due to the process of serpentinization. They migrate through the migration channels and form oil and gas deposits in any kind of rock in any kind of traps. Scientific considerations about the origin of hydrocarbons, discovered reserves of unconventional gas, particularly shale gas and gas hydrates provide an understanding of the presence of enormous, virtually inexhaustible hydrocarbon resources in our planet. We clearly have enough hydrocarbon resources for several hundred years. To ensure the sustainable development of this energy resource we need to create and implement into the market innovative technologies for hydrocarbon deposit exploration and exploitation. The environmental aspect should be one of the main criteria to assess these new technologies. A new international research program which would take into consideration the possibility of the abiogenic origin of hydrocarbons could be one of the most efficient contributions in the development of strategic scenarios for energy production in this century, where hydrocarbons will dominate. It could yield social, economic and environmental benefits well beyond our imagination. Of course, not all players in the international petroleum domain would welcome this, but science is always about overturning yesterday’s ideas with those of today and tomorrow.', 'With a slight decline in 2009 global gas consumption has been growing by 2-3% during the past decades. By developing gas shales production, the US has been working towards N.American energy independence, whereas EU and Asia-Pacific Region countries are still far away from these goals. At the same time if EU countries tend to improve energy efficiency, APR remains as the main region that influences gas consumption growth. EU gas market declined over the past 2 years approximately by 60 bcm or by 10%. During the last couple of years gas imports to Europe have seen reductions. Qatar at the same time is doing its best at aiming toward EU market. Having signed up supplies to Belgium, Spain (whose traditional supplier has been Algeria), Italy (with Eni also interested in Libyan gas via Greenstream pipeline) and France, Qatar’s total share of the European gas market is now approaching 10%. Poland, its other client has started its own shale production in 2013. The outlook for EU, US and Asia gas markets that have independent and distinct pricing mechanisms is drawing attention to further synergies and coherence. Lower spot prices on UK NBP have already resulted in dissolving a number of agreements regarding supply from Russia. Japan is planning to introduce LNG futures trading system in 2015. It&#39;s also quite possible that in Asia a larger role will be assigned to the TPP that by far has enhanced LNG trade and investment among 11 partner countries and may even become an alternative to the APEC. These changes&#39; will influence US, EU and Asian markets. Even though it’s quite likely that we shall be seeing more steps towards global gas market in the future, no gas exporter is interested in rapid lowering of the fossil fuel price. Other ways of influencing high prices, incl. political, will be used.', 'Production Sharing Contract (PSC) currently used in the global oil and gas exploration and production activities, was first formulated during the early 1960s in Indonesia and contemplated mainly for use in the field of conventional oil and gas predominating at that time. Today much has changed. As a result of ever increasing global energy demand, high oil price and breakthroughs in exploration and development technologies, nowadays we have witnessed a discernible shift of global energy focus from conventional oil and gas to unconventional ones, with international oil and gas operations in the latter field becoming increasingly active and playing a major role. However, the current PSC practice has lagged behind in that it doesn’t respond well to the many significant differences and particularities of unconventional vis-à-vis conventional oil and gas. Against this background, this paper will conduct a comparison of unconventional and conventional oil and gas in terms of their differences in resource characteristics, development & production patterns, investment arrangements as well as economic aspects. Based on this, the paper will analyze the limitations of the conventional PSC terms and conditions as applied to the field of unconventional oil and gas and will offer adjustment suggestions to make it better suited for global exploration and production activities in unconventional oil and gas.', 'The objective of this study is to analyze the long term equilibrium price between the oil and the gas prices through a co-integration relationship between these prices in the US market. Many studies show high co-integration between the crude oil and natural gas prices in the long term. Nevertheless, in the last few years, it was noted that the two price series appear to have “decoupled”; the co-integrating relationship does not appear to be stable through time. Until 2005, even with no direct linkage between oil prices and natural gas prices, the two tended to move together, with the prices for oil ($/bbl) and natural gas ($/mmBtu) maintaining a relatively stable ratio of around 7:1. However, as oil prices climbed from an average of $56 per barrel in 2005 to an average of $100 in 2008, the discount for natural gas relative to oil also grew to 11:1 in 2008. After 2008, the natural gas discount relative to oil widened further, as oil prices remained relatively high while growing U.S. shale gas production helped to weaken natural gas prices. The oil-to-gas price ratio grew to an average of more than 35:1 in 2012, with a Btu of crude oil selling for more than five times the price for a Btu of natural gas. In EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2013 Reference case, the U.S. price differential narrows gradually to in increasing ratio in 2040, as shale gas production moves to more expensive and difficult-to-produce resources and natural gas prices rise. In our study, we try to explore the apparent contradiction between the short and long term co-integration of the oil and the gas prices in the US market. Furthermore, we will point out the impact of the new production from the shale gas on this relationship which includes several structural breaks.', 'Shale gas is part of what is described as ‘unconventional gas’. The ‘shale gas revolution’ is a phenomenon that brought forth abundant domestic gas supply in the US. Share of shale gas rose from less than 1% of domestic gas production in the US in 2000 to over 20% by 2010.The EIA projects that it will account for 46% of US gas supply by 2035.The shale gas developments in the US are likely to have a significant impact on global gas markets, creating an oversupply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) which can potentially put downward pressure on gas prices. Until now, the Department of Energy (DoE) has permitted export from 28 LNG terminals to countries covered under Free Trade Agreements (FTA). Out of these, three terminals have also been given an export license for Non-FTA countries. This will help develop an advanced shale market not just in US but also strengthen the support (technological & knowledge) in other markets of the world. As with all energy use, shale gas must be produced in a manner that prevents, minimizes and mitigates environmental damage and the risk of accidents and protects public health and safety. With shale gas output expansion public concern and debate about the production of shale gas has also grown .Four major challenges in this regard are: (1) Possible pollution of drinking water from methane and chemicals used in fracturing fluids; (2) Air pollution;(3) Community disruption during shale gas production; and (4) Cumulative adverse impacts that intensive shale production can have on communities and ecosystems. Some or all these issues need to be addressed at greater lengths in order to move forward and leverage the benefits that Shale has to offer as a future fuel. The paper considers impact of Shale gas on existing supply and demand systems and its resulting geopolitical impact.', 'In the last decade, there has appeared a determining factor for gas markets: the US shale gas. Since 2007 production has grown noticeably and this not only provides energy supply independence and low prices to the American gas market, but, with the launch of the first liquefaction plant in Sabine Pass, it also turns its role from being a gas importer to become an exporter from 2016. Besides this project, there are more than a dozen initiatives with a greater or lesser degree of development. Worldwide the huge development of the LNG industry has globalized gas market. While in the past we found very defined and stable markets in price formation that moved similarly, now we have decoupled markets but with a trend towards changing its future price formation. This opens up a range of possibilities allowing other regions, such as Asia where demand is expected to rise faster than in other places, to benefit from geographic diversification of supply sources and also access to a cheaper gas. Considering sustainability parameters, shale gas and the growth of the LNG industry, there is a clear opportunity to slow down the consumption of fossil fuel reserves. Although it would be desirable, even a greater geographic extent of this potential effect, it doesn&#39;t look easy as most of the world gas is transported by pipeline. Within this scenario, Gas Natural Fenosa will play a very important role thanks to the prime of its gas supply portfolio- diversified and flexible-, for its long and proven experience as operator of LNG and its position in the Atlantic basin. The perfect complement is the supply agreement with Cheniere, having free destination LNG in USA for the next 20 years.', 'India’s growth story has resulted in increased energy consumption and thus need for uninterrupted, economical viable & clean fuel supplies. In view of the lack of sufficient indigenous supply options to mitigate the growing demand-supply gap, India is bound to consider unconventional resources. Unconventional resources encompass tight oil and gas formations, shale gas, coal-bed methane, heavy oil, oil shale, deep and ultra deep water plays, and gas hydrates. Shale-gas being projected as new mantra, a game-changer, has thus called for attention and serious consideration by Indian policy makers. The most significant contribution from Indian side towards shale gas exploration has been the supply of guar or cluster beans which is used to increase the viscosity of proppants, materials which are forced into shale fractures to enlarge them so that the oil and gas can be extracted. In India, shale deposits are found across the Gangetic plain, Assam, Rajasthan and many coastal areas but estimation of reserves have not been carried out thoroughly. There are various factors that policy makers will need to scrutinize before going ahead with commercial production of shale gas. Expertise of local producers and service sector, land use, availability of infrastructure, availability of data and its analysis, treatment of water and containment are few such issues. SWOT analysis has been done to establish the status of system and thus study internal and external development environment. A development strategy is formulated to address the issues and suggest a way forward.', '', '', '', '', 'Chinese oil & gas storage and transportation developed fast since 2000 and have already formed the basic pipeline network and storage system which was also the fruits of technology development. Particularly in these years, the new technologies and research results of Chinese oil & gas storage and transportation industry multiplied.

This paper will examine the case for change in LNG shipping and share experiences from the industry’s largest operator in driving efficiencies to improve safety, cost and environmental performance. It will also propose future opportunities for the LNG shipping industry to embed common operational standards. The increase in LNG producers, consumers and shipping routes, coupled with economic volatility, fuel cost pressures and stricter emissions controls will make traditional LNG shipping practices unsustainable in the future. The LNG shipping industry must modernise its processes, learn from other industries and apply new technologies to succeed in this challenging environment. The airline business provides a compelling example of how safe and efficient operations can be delivered consistently across a global industry, underpinned by common standards. The world’s largest LNG shipping operator delivers over 33 million tonnes of LNG per year and has embarked on an efficiency programme to safely drive down costs and emissions on voyages by the 43 LNG ships it manages. Working with stakeholders, it analysed and identified efficiency improvements in around 105 activities from arrival to discharge and maintenance. Improvements will save around 90 days in 2013 alone and include: · Reducing berth times through advance planning on turnaround by crew and terminal staff. · Increasing filling limits to enable additional LNG cargo/voyage. · Reducing fuel consumption by enhancing vessels and equipment. · Comingling of bunkers. · Implementing night port transits. · Accelerating dry-docking projects. There is an outstanding opportunity for the LNG shipping industry to simplify, standardise and modernise operations to meet future challenges on safety, cost efficiency and environmental performance.', '1. Gas is becoming increasingly important as a reliable, affordable source of energy – and its share of the energy mix is expected to grow. 2. Gas resources and gas consumers are, however, often far apart. The close/readily available resources were produced first, and more distant reservoirs must now be brought to market. 3. Dry gas pipelines and vessel transport with liquefied gas are two ways to bring gas to market. The rapid increase of LNG capacities – liquefaction and transport tonnage – has been impressive. 4. Pipeline transported gas has – however – been remarkably resilient and stable, other places even growing. This proves that new transport solutions, instead of cannibalizing the market, has expanded the overall market for gas. 5. The longer distances we now see put some challenges to pipeline projects, since long pipelines cross many national borders, while national regulations have a domestic focus. 6. There are some mitigations we see that the industry has taken to overcome this: a. Form international ownership consortia to broaden the ownership, financing pool, and competence pool. b. Apply internationally accepted technical standards for safety & integrity – to secure an overall system integrity. c. Work with suppliers across the world, to make sure that the best technologies are mobilized. 7. Blue Stream (2 * 24” gas pipelines to Turkey from Russia across the Black Sea) and Nord Stream (2 * 42” gas pipelines to Germany from Russia across the Baltic Sea) are two examples of this trend in international capital intensive pipeline projects. 8. DNV will in this paper review recent industry risk mitigating trends and propose lessons for the future.', 'The paper analyzes geopolitical circumstances in the energy markets in the first decades of the 21st century. After oil prices leap, gas crisis in Eastern Europe, and geopolitical instabilities connected with energy issues, the gas supply has entered into the phase of possible supply crises, political instability and major disturbances. Such a scenario could have an adverse impact on energy importers and their efforts to ensure secure and affordable supply, especially when it comes to relatively small countries in the SEE region. Geopolitical developments mainly result from an uneven distribution of global oil and gas production and consumption. They affect all participants in the global energy market, particularly those with small indigenous production. Croatia meets 60 percent of its gas demand from domestic production but this share will decline. Similarly to other SEE countries, it will need more imported energy, particularly oil and gas. Participation and cooperation in large international transport and supply projects is the most likely solution for securing sufficient energy. The SEE countries have been heavily hit by global economic crises. Investments in energy sector have been postponed due to the recession. Economic recovery (investments) is crucial for ensuring energy security & supply. Therefore it is important to design appropriate energy strategies and create attractive conditions for investments. Croatia is making efforts in this direction. It will facilitate the cooperation in international energy projects and further development of natural gas market and infrastructure in the SEE region. Croatia has some advantages as the future possible gas market hub: geopolitical and geographic position, political stability as EU member state, considerable domestic natural gas production in addition to connections to the several European gas routes and possible LNG entry point into the South-East European gas market.', 'Advances in technology, increases in reserves in remote locations and higher oil prices have recently stimulated a surge in interest in developing GTL projects. GTL plants produce conventional oil products as well as specialist products. All the plants already in operation, under construction or planned are based on the Fischer-Tropsch technology originally developed in Germany in the 1920s. Recent technical advances, including improved catalysts, have significantly improved liquid yields and reduced both capital and operating costs. GTL technology is now seen as a potential alternative to LNG as a way of exploiting gas reserves in remote locations. The economics of GTL processing are highly dependent on plant construction costs, product types and yields and the energy efficiency of the plant, as well as the market prices of the liquids produced and the cost of the gas feedstock. GTL plants are complex and capital-intensive, requiring large sites and construction lead times of two-and-a-half to three years. They are also very energy intensive, consuming up to 45% of the gas feedstock. This characteristic raises concerns about CO 2 emissions. On the other hand, GTL plants generally produce a range of middle distillates with good environmental qualities, demand for which is rising. Large-scale commercial development of GTL technology will depend on achieving higher yields of readily marketable products such as gasoline and middle distillates, with lower yields of speciality products, for which markets are limited. The viability of GTL may also be dependent on the absence of any penalty for carbon emissions. In practice, GTL is likely to compete for investment funds against both oil refining and alternative ways of exploiting gas reserves. GTL may be the preferred option for “stranded” gas reserves, where the cost of piping or shipping the gas as LNG to markets is prohibitive .', 'Pundit energy economy uses natural gas as a bridge to achieve sustainable development based on new energy and renewable energy transition periods. Experts believe that for the next two decades fossil energy will play a major role in providing the energy needed. Because of environmental concerns regarding oil and coal, the growth in demand for the cleaner natural gas, particularly in developed economies compared to other fossil fuels has increased. The global interest is moving towards natural gas as are investments in the development of gas fields. Development of new technologies to exploit unconventional gas as well as gas transmission and distribution network spread all over the world during the next two decades, gas rule is outlined in the global energy market. In such circumstances, increseased levels of trade and the flow of natural gas from production areas to consumption, in addition to the economic aspects of the security, and geopolitical importance can be seen. In this paper an attempt has been made to assess the prospects for the global and regional production and consumption of natural gas, the trade outlook for natural gas in the world and major regions, entirely explain the difference with the current situation are described. Also, given the geopolitical importance of the gas - gas landscape of global trade, production and trade in gas, and target markets will be reviewed and explained.', 'Very large natural gas supplies are scattered around the Globe. Gas from the Eurasian continent could be available, particularly for China and Northeast Asia. Large scale LNG supplies are available from the Russian island of Sakhalin, north of Japan, and exported to Asia. There are also major supplies from Kazakhstan, around the Caspian,Turkmenistan and Iran, all of which are large gas reserve holders. There are prospects of sizeable gas supplies from offshore Myanmar. As far as current infrastructure is concerned, a major pipeline has started supplying gas from Turkmenistan to China. Another pipeline is being laid to China from Myanmar to supply gas from the offshore fields in the Bay of Bengal. The interesting thing is that though the most economical way to move gas to East Asia is from East Siberia, in the absence of any pipeline supply from East Siberia, China has started sourcing gas from Central Asia and elsewhere. The decision by Russia to monetize these assets will have a major impact on the Asian gas demand-supply gap. Transnational pipelines are complex ventures, as different countries have different interests. Neighboring countries are often found to bring on board a substantial and complex political baggage of disharmony and discord and routing of the pipelines often encounters difficult terrain and politically and environmentally sensitive areas. Challenges of such magnitude require the mobilization of huge financial and technological resources from international sources and an atmosphere of mutual trust and confidence. Given the requirement of large investments, it is a challenge to design financing schemes that work. Multilateral financial institutions like the World Bank and ADB can play a key transitional role in such projects. Over and above, there is a need for a high level of commitment by all the participating countries for establishing sound regulatory and pricing policies.', 'In the cracks contained in metals under the action of corrosive media, gas can be accumulated. It is important to be able to predict the behavior of cracks under such conditions. In metals, hydrogen is usually dissolved in the proton form. When reaching crack surfaces, protons recombine with electrons to form molecular hydrogen inside the cavity. Thus the pressure inside may become so large that the crack can propagate only under the excessive pressure of gas hydrogen accumulated inside the crack even with no external loading. An important example of diffusion-controlled fracture growth is given by hydrogen induced delamination of pipe-line coating. In this work, for a penny-shaped crack in an unbounded elastic medium and for a thin penny-shaped delamination under the surface of a half-space, as well as for similar cracks-strips, in a uniform way – on the basis of the energy approach and with the use of Clapeyron theorem – kinetic equations were derived describing the growth of specified defects under gas diffusion into them. The equations turned out to be integrable in quadratures for an arbitrary function of crack front velocity on the stress intensity factor. A study of the solution and the analysis of crack development in typical cases were given. It was shown that the large-time crack growth rate tends to a constant, for which a simple formula was given. For a representative example of a bulk sample of low-carbon steel, we estimate the doubling time of the defect with the typical values of mechanical and diffusion parameters of the problem. The results obtained provide the basis for a better understanding of some mechanisms of slow growth of cracks and delaminations in gas pipelines, for prediction of their development, resource assessment of structures and development of defectiveness standards for them.', '"The list of accidents caused by oïl tankers and resulting spills in recent years, is important and long, such as the Torry Canyon, Amoco Cadiz, Exon Valdez, Erica, Prestige,ect.... and forced governments and oil companies to work to gather. Today 60% of mondial transport of crude oil is assured by tankers. The oil and gas companies transport important quantities of crude oil and gas by pipelines or by tankers (sea); these two methods generate pollution in different ways; Accidental; Operational Sonatrach Algeria created the international company working with international oil companies like France, Nigeria, Italy, Morocco, etc. The hazard of oil pollution caused by tankers which transport crude oil are either accidental or operational. At the international level it is necessary to introduce regulations for the “repression and prevention of the pollution"" The international legal regime for compensation of oil pollution damage works quite efficiently in case of minor oil spills caused by tankers. At the same time, the accidents listed in the beginning disclose the serious implementation gaps affecting the international civil liability regime when applied to major marine casualties producing extensive pollution damage. The ceilings for compensation are manifestly too low and most of the pollution damage caused is not, especially damaging to the environment per se. For this reason, most conventions will be adopted by the responsibility and the reparation of the damages caused by the crude oil pollution. However oil companies and governments of the producers of crude oil companies are placing big attention to the evolution of international conventions like the 69 convention, the 92 convention and the international oil pollution funds indemnisation and funds compensation for damages caused by oil tanker accidents (IOP C funds)."', 'Hydrocarbon reservoirs which underline the territory of two or more countries are sometimes subjected to legal challenges, while it could be also a basis for developing cooperation among those countries in achieving sustainable extractioI, more productivity and peace. However if neighboring countries do not reach an agreement on how to explore the cross border field, no international convention obliges them to cooperate and international courts also don’t imply a duty to do so. So law institutions should, necessarily, shape solutions which decrease the risk of conflict and cause sustainable extraction and development for the economy and peace in neighboring countries. Beside this, officials of countries involved in such a case, must be well aware of the benefits of making a unitization (or joint development) agreement as well as risks for their economy and peace in case of pending such an agreement. This study initially investigates the status of the cross border hydrocarbon reservoirs in Middle East, Africa and Europe and the situation of involved countries. By evaluating both successful and unsuccessful case studies, lessons learnt beside the careful consideration of existed international laws, will bring some suggestions and proposed frameworks to develop these types of oil and gas fields by highly considering management of associated risks and sustainable extraction of fields.', 'This paper explores existing problems experienced in long distance transportation of oil and gas system integrity due to some imperfections of the Quality Management Systems for Pipeline Construction. Pipeline design codes give us minimum structural integrity requirements. In reality the only defects that should be revealed are those which might lead to an unacceptable safety level for pipeline construction and operation, or a high probability for destruction risk of the pipeline structure. All other individual defects, or combination of defects, allowable according to the design codes or technical requirements, remain in the pipeline. These codes, and their acceptance levels, have been shown to be effective. However, construction defects are sometimes detected during service, and they require assessment. The research focuses on applying the same process used for the Fitness for Service techniques to evaluate non-critical defects, which are remaining on the pipeline after construction. As they do for Fitness for Service processes, we can to assess the admissibility of non-critical defects by calculating the risks of failure for each defect, based on profile, geometry and material properties and depending on usage and environmental conditions. By performing a technique to evaluate non-critical defects, which are remaining on the pipeline after construction, significant improvement in system integrity can be achieved by utilizing proper schedule maintenance, diagnosis and repair of pipeline on the basis of forecasting the probability of failure as function of non-critical construction defect severity parameters, identified during the construction control.', '', '', 'International Association CEDIGAZ&#39;s forecasts, indicate that Asia-Pacific will drive both global gas demand and LNG trade until 2030. The growing regional dependence on imports raises major issues like supply security, investment and gas competitiveness. After analysing specific challenges and new commercial opportunities for Asian gas market, CEDIGAZ concludes on the structural changes required to ensure the future expansion of the Asian gas industry. According to CEDIGAZ, Asia-Pacific will continue to be the fastest-growing regional gas market in the future, accounting for up to 45% of the global demand growth from now to 2030, on the back of strong economic growth and the attendant increase in energy demand. It is now expected to surpass North America to become the largest consumer market. The most important growth driver is the boom of emerging markets. In most of them, natural gas is making a growing contribution to the energy mix, under the effect of supportive energy policies and fuel switching requirements from oil to gas, especially in the power sector. One particularity of the Asian market is the lack of pipeline exchanges and infrastructures and the growing reliance on LNG imports. Asia will remain the powerhouse behind global LNG demand growth, under the impulsion of China, India and South East Asia. But as of today, two-thirds of the total required regional LNG supply in 2030 remains un-contracted. The growing regional gap between supply and demand raises major issues such as security of supply, competitiveness of gas and massive investment requirements in infrastructures. The Asian market will have to adapt effectively to a world where the interactions between different fuels, markets and prices are intensifying. Evolutions of pricing, trading and contractual conditions will also open real opportunities for growth of the Asian gas industry.', 'In recent years, as the Northeast Asian economy has gained momentum, Northeast Asia has been among the regions witnessing the fastest growth in energy consumption around the world. Meanwhile, the raising awareness of environmental protection has also resulted in an increasing value of natural gas as a relatively clean fossil energy. In light of such awareness, the consumption of natural gas is continually growing and the proportion it is taking in the primary energy consumption mix is also rising. But the distribution of natural gas resources in Northeast Asian countries is seriously uneven. In particular, Russia has huge export potential due to its abundant natural gas reserves, whereas China, Japan and South Korea have already imported natural gas on large scales, with an imported volume of LNG accounting for more than 60% of the world’s total, because of their relatively poor natural gas reserves, Mongolia and North Korea are two potential gas consuming countries. Natural gas demand in Northeast Asia is expected to maintain a rapid growth momentum in the next 20 years, and the unbalance between supply and demand in this region will remain prominent. Therefore, several measures must be adopted to ensure the stable and safe gas supply of Northeast Asia. These necessary measures include: to accelerate the research and development of theories and techniques concerning natural gas, to facilitate the exploration and exploitation of domestic conventional and unconventional natural gas, to strengthen regional cooperation and interconnect regional pipeline network, and to import natural gas in multi-ways and through multi-channels. \xa0', 'Being home to two of the largest growing economies China & India, Asian energy demand has been expanding rapidly. Unlike Japan, where natural gas contributes to 22% of the energy mix, share of natural gas in China & India is below 10%. This is set to change as the governments have unveiled ambitious targets to increase the usage of gas to address the air quality concerns. As per IEA, China alone will account for 30% of the growth of global gas demand by next five years. Despite the growth in domestic production, both the countries are largely depending on imports to meet the growing demand. Due to geo political issues, Asian countries prefer imports through LNG terminals than Trans National gas pipelines. Today 9 countries in Asia have LNG import terminals & met its 46% of the gas demand in 2012 using LNG. The role of LNG is set to increase further with increase in demand from China & India. LNG import capacity of these two countries is to increase by more than 60% & Asia’s total LNG import capacity is expected to touch 450 MMTPA by 2025. On supply side, global LNG availability has been increasing. New liquefaction plants of around 60 MMTPA are already under construction in Australia. With revolution of shale gas, more than 18 liquefaction projects have been proposed in North America most of them targeting the rising Asian demand. East Africa with huge gas reserves has potential to supply LNG for next wave of liquefaction projects that would come up beyond 2020. This growth of LNG infrastructure in Asia along with increase in global LNG availability globally will lead to flexibility in terms of source & destination. This will in turn increase the liquidity in Asian region providing an opportunity for Hub based pricing in Asia.', 'The balance in international politics and economy is shifting to the East. Economic development requires energy resources; shifting balance requires new geopolitical approaches. One of the keys for that is gas market development – it can provide fuel for development and gives countries a geopolitical tool when responding to the challenges. The way these challenges are dealt with ultimately depends on the level of prices, which in its turn depends on the way the price is set. One of the debated objectives in Asia Pacific is to develop a freer market for gas trade, and one of the ways is to set a gas-trading hub where gas prices would be determined on a competitive basis. The extent to which the Asia Pacific region will manage to switch to competitive pricing will determine the role of gas in the regional market. The main focus of the paper is the possibility of a continued process of integration between the regional gas markets into a single world gas market, and the dynamics of gas pricing mechanisms development in different regions (and in Asia Pacific in particular) as an indicator of such integration. The paper overviews pricing mechanisms worldwide; assesses the perspectives for pricing in the APR. It concludes that the process of the change in gas pricing paradigm is a complicated one while the prospects of a regional hub in APR are rather doubtful due to the supply outlook (largely secured via long-term contracts in medium term); and there is a resulting uncertainty relating to the possibility of price signals transmission between the regional gas markets even in case of the start of new supplies, i.e. from North America. Thus, the global gas market is postponed, once again.\xa0', 'Involving the countries with important gas resources, the Caspian Region attracts all major energy players in the world. As a result of this appeal, from the view of supply and demand security, there is a critical balance and very complex struggle among these major players. To analyze the gas supply-demand balances in the field of policies: first of all; it is better to define the main players of the region. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the long-term plans; it is very important to examine the planned and existing production and transferring infrastructure in the region (pipelines, LNG terminals and other related facilities). In this study, initially, by mentioning the importance of the Caspian Region for world gas markets, portfolios of the important players who are active and who want to be active in this region will be analyzed. Secondly, by shortly defining the possible energy security issues of each player, their 2035 targets for gas resources in Caspian will be estimated. To analyze the success possibility of these targets; resource development plans, the supply/demand potentials, transportation capacities in 2035 will be described. In this way, we will try to predict the results of the struggle in gas politics in the region.', 'Description At the present time, there is pressure on the current gas pricing system. Factors which are putting pressure on the gas pricing system are: 1) Shale gas revolution in the US (USA virtually stopped importing LNG and LNG to USA is being diverted elsewhere. This is causing gas glut in the market and putting pressure on the spot gas price downwards.) 2) Impending gas export from North America. Cheap gas from North America is beginning export as early as in 2016. Another downward pressure on the gas price and the gas pricing system. 3) Demand for changes for LNG gas-pricing structure led by Asian pacific countries, especially by Japan. Japan’s attempt to bring down current high gas price. Japan to launch LNG futures market in 2014 or 2015. Applications LNG spot market LNG/pipeline long term contract of gas between suppliers and buyers Technical contributions 1) Investigation of the changes of current gas pricing and prediction of system changes in the future. 2) Description of implications in the introduction of new pricing formula 3) Explanation of influence of shale gas revolution on the world gas market, especially on the East Asian market. 4) History of gas pricing and claims on why change is necessary The introduction of the new price formula may put pressure on the current gas pricing system linked to crude oil. LNG exports projects awaits approvals from US and Canadian government. Due to the price differentials between US gas price and others, if US government approves export projects, there will be influence on the spot gas market in Europe and the gas pricing structure in the Asia Pacific. There is the possibility of more diverse and flexible forms of contract other than long term oil-indexed contract and TOP regulation. Oil-linked price formula is expected to continue. In addition, the possible co-existence of Henry hub-linked gas pricing system and oil-linked pricing system with shorter term contracts.', 'Background and Purpose North East Asia countries such as China, Japan and the Republic of Korea have engaged in a heated rivalry to secure supply of the unconventional gases in Canada, USA and other countries. The Republic of Korea, the 2nd largest importer of Liquefied Natural Gas in the world, has recognized the unconventional gas’ role not only for the energy security but also economic costs. Thus, it is significant to know for the nation what LNG made of conventional or unconventional gases, is more attractive in terms of cost and what other risk factors can hinder its import.Method This study examines economies of 7 LNGs varied by play (Mozambique, Russian Vladivostok, US Eagle Ford, Oman, Canadian Montney, Australian Clarence Moreton) and type of production source: Conventional, Unconventional gases (Shale Gas, Tight Gas and Coal Bed Methane). Both current producers exporting LNG to Korea and potential producers are selected for the subjects of the study considering the producer’s relationship with Korea. Firstly, import costs of LNG are analyzed on Delivered Ex Ship basis under the presumption that price formula is not specified on a long-term contract. Then quantitative risk assessment is used to determine other critical factors, thereby resulting to an impact on the LNG supply. Results The preliminary result of the cost analysis demonstrates that import of conventional gas LNG from Qatar and Sakhalin is still cost-effective rather than the unconventional gas, and also economically feasible in terms of cost and transportation duration. Furthermore, it indicates that LNG made of tight gas and CBM would be a good economic cost benchmark as long as applied shale gas project whose breakeven costs are mostly high. However, the result of quantitative risk assessment shows that each project has different level of risk and benefits for the export except the cost problems. The result of the cost-risk analysis can serve a significant role in understanding the price competitiveness and the possible risks of LNG suppliers in North East Asian market, especially the Republic of Korea.\xa0', 'Black shale is studied because of its economic value, paleoclimatic and paleogeographic significance. Unlike most countries, especially America, China is featured by multiple sedimentary facies shale, not only marine shale. Shales in China can mainly divided into three kinds, including shale deposited in marine facies, shale deposited in transitional facies and shale deposited in terrestrial facies. Each kind of shale has attracted a lot of attention since the rapid energy consumption and decreasing conventional energy resources. Different shale has different characteristics. This study focuses on characteristic comparison among various facies shale in China. The paleoenvironment, the organic content, organic matter maturity, kerogen type, mineral composition, gas content and reservoir characteristics of black shale in different facies were obtained by cores, outcrops, slices analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-Ray fluorescence spectrum and field site canister desorption. The study result indicates that Marine shale distributed in Lower Paleozoic is characterized by wide distribution, large thickness, type-I and II 1 kerogen, high maturity, high brittle mineral content, low clay content, well developed nano-pores, and the average gas content is of 2.0 m 3 /t. The transitional shale distributed mainly in Xujiahe Formation in Triassic, Sichuan Basin and Shanxi Formation in Permian, Ordos Basin. The shale deposited in transitional facies is featured by thin single layer, large accumulative thickness, discontinuous distribution in lateral, type-II and III kerogen, moderate maturity, equivalent brittle mineral and clay content. What’s more, such shale is mainly composed of matrix pores and less developed nano-pore, and the average gas content can reach 0.86 m 3 /t. Terrestrial shale mainly distributes in Yanchang Formation in Triassic, Ordos Basin and Shahejie Formation in Eogene, Bohai Bay Basin. The shale is characterized by large single layer thickness, rapid lateral facies change, multiple kerogen type, low maturity, mainly in oil generation stage, less intensive diagenesis, high clay content, well developed intergranular pore and moderate gas content which can reach 1.27 m 3 /t. Since shales in different sedimentary environment are different, different strategies should be adopted when extracting shale gas from different shales. \xa0', 'Nowadays the energy trend leads oil companies to request integrated modular buildings and modularized process plants, in order to reduce the delivery time and site problems. The most important advantage of this approach allows to maximize activities and tests at the workshop/fabrication yard, drastically reducing the time between PO award and startup. This is valid for offshore applications where the advantage of modules are well known, but it is more frequently required even for onshore fields, especially for locations where ground transportation are difficult and soil conditions (permafrost) require very compact plants in order to reduce civil works to the least. The aim of this paper is to report some case studies regarding projects successfully delivered by COMART and Tozzi Sud (companies of Tozzi Industries) where modularized plants and prefabricated buildings have been supplied for several on-shore fields. A natural gas treatment plant and LPG and Condensates treatment plants in Bolivia, Gas dehydration plants in Thailand and Saudi Arabia, Local Equipment Rooms and Process Utility Buildings installed in Kazakhstan are some examples of projects where remote locations or transportation limits and handling limitations conditioned engineering and fabrication phase, requiring for modularized units approach. The purpose of the paper is to describe the criteria adopted from the engineering point of view, taking into account the different configurations of the “life-cycle” of the plant (assembling at workshop, testing, dismantling for transportation, shipment, lifting for reassembly at site and commissioning). Obviously the approach reflects in the project execution strategy, which is discussed in detail to evaluate pros and cons of the modularization philosophy. Finally the paper intends to analyze the benefits of the modularization providing some lessons learnt by the engineering and project execution plan point of view.', 'Qatargas has supplied LNG to 22 countries across 4 continents since 1997, with the large majority of today’s volumes being delivered into Asia. This gives us unique perspectives into Asia Pacific and Middle Eastern markets. This abstract draws implications from the region’s LNG marketplace to make conclusions on how to successfully supply Asia. Asia Pacific’s LNG demand will grow robustly to 2025, driven by both traditional and new importers. Increasing LNG imports are due to the region’s sustained economic growth and desire for reliable and clean energy sources in the face of often declining traditional gas supplies. In the Middle East, rising populations and industrial expansion will increase the need for LNG deliveries to supplement the region’s domestic gas supplies. However, considerable uncertainty surrounds where the incremental LNG supply to meet Asia’s growing demand will come from. The Australian projects currently under construction need to navigate the potential for cost overruns and startup delays. There are also still questions regarding the ultimate balance between US LNG exports and gas dedicated for domestic users. Other regions have significant undeveloped gas reserves for potential LNG exports but face high costs, partly due to their greenfield projects’ proposed frontier locations. Asian LNG importers, therefore, place high value on certainty of supplies to meet their growing demand. Buyers desire sourcing long-term volumes directly from a producer with long-standing relationships and a proven track-record of safe and reliable deliveries. Supplier flexibility is also required to meet buyers’ requirements for commissioning, short-term and long-term volumes. In addition, importers value supplier innovation, for example delivering on larger ships to reduce transportation costs. Qatargas has been consistently fulfilling these needs since signing our first Japanese SPA in 1992. We also have volumes available today and our enviable geographic location helps make us particularly well suited to meeting Asia’s increasing LNG demands.', 'Any energy discussion must focus on the energy need of the human being and economic growth. Approximately 1 billion of the Asian population does not have access to electricity to get the basic amenities. Today the energy scarcity in Pakistan has gone up to an alarming level and the country’s economy is on the verge of breakdown. The biggest challenge for the energy industry today is how to make affordable and clean energy available to all. The Asian Gas scenario is fast changing, driven by the following three emerging trends. 1. Asia is driving the Global energy demand 2. US Shale Gas revolution has transformed the Gas pricing matrix . 3. As clean fuel, the share of gas is increasing in the Asian fuel mix. The energy consumption of Asia has tripled since 1980 and it is projected to grow about 60 % by 2040. China has recently replaced USA as World’s largest net fuel importer. The Shale Gas revolution has reduced the gas price in US and gas has been trading in North America at a 10 year low price. By innovative technologies such as horizontal directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing, new supply of natural gas has been brought to America’s economy and the technological innovations have surfaced enough natural gas to power US economy at current demand for more than a century. Many of the Import terminals in US are being converted to Gas dispatch terminals. This has direct bearing to Asian Gas supply as due to supply abundance; US exporters are also desperate to supply Gas in Asia. Though coal is the primary energy source, increasing environment consciousness and global warming, Asian countries have started demanding greener energy. before the Fukushima disaster, 30 % of Japan’s energy was being supplied by Nuclear power, but after the incident , the use of natural gas has in Japan has increased by 60 % and as per the latest information, the World’s third largest economy has taken initiative to be the atomic energy free country by 2013. On the supply front, the estimated recoverable Shale gas in China is considered to be more than gas reserves in USA and Canada combined. The gas production in China has also gone up exponentially in recent years. Latest technologies are being applied in China to overcome the challenges of exploration. New technologies such ‘Floating LNG’ liquefaction facilities can also play as game changer in Asia. Gas exploration by its very nature is highly time and capital intensive and here International partnership plays the most important role. We must also take lessons from our past experience of energy innovation and investment. Due to unique geopolitical nature of Asia, the transportation of Gas is also a major challenge in Asia. There. To address this, many transnational gas pipelines are coming in this region which is helping all the member countries.\xa0', '', '', 'Sakhalin Energy, one of the larger integrated oil & gas projects, executed under the first signed PSA in Russia, obtained international project financing at the end of the last decade. Rob van Velden, Finance Director of Sakhalin Energy, will discuss the challenges the Company went through to obtain project financing, and the impact of project financing on Sakhalin Energy’s ongoing operations. Today, the Company has established a strong reputation in the Asia Pacific LNG market and has good relations with its lenders group. The Company is confident about its future and looking for possibilities to expand the project where additional project financing may well play a key role yet again.\xa0', 'The huge scale of investment required to meet energy demand over the next 20 years is well known to the petroleum industry, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimating that some US1 trillion a year will need to be invested over this period. In all segments of the petroleum industry structural changes are now underway which are altering its fundamental nature. What is perhaps less widely discussed, is that such changes will have a significant impact on how the industry is financed in future years. The industry’s required investments will necessitate greater diversification of funding sources and more innovative financing structures from a range of equity and debt providers. International banks will continue to play an important role in providing reserve-based loan products. Multilateral agencies will remain important as both producing and consuming countries promote energy developments. However, reflecting tougher regulatory requirements, the capacity of the bank market for long-term debt may be a challenge, and is likely to be available at a higher cost than in the past. The increasing importance of NOCs means that IOCs will face more competition for funding new developments, often in higher risk environments and this may impact the financing costs. However, despite all the challenges and changes in the industry and the bank financing environment by combining the various sources of funding, the financing needs of the oil and gas industry should be met in the future.', 'The last few years can be broadly characterized by a scarcity of public equity financing, combined with corporate credit conditions that were initially tight but are now loosening. Banks have been through a process of rebuilding their balance sheets. In many jurisdictions, this process has been largely completed but in some key ones a lot of work remains. However, caution around risk management and the pressure to deliver an appropriate return has led banks to tighten lending standards, particularly for small-to-medium sized borrowers. In this paper we will analyse the more innovative financing solutions being adopted by oil and gas companies, and consider the benefits and limitations of the different options. Governments of resource poor countries may provide loan guarantee programs for their state-owned enterprises looking to secure access to overseas supplies. Additionally, governments may seek to raise investment to fund oil and gas developments through partial IPOs of NOCs. Some NOCs are seeking to take advantage of the current rally in emerging market bond markets, due to low interest rates in the US and Europe. Other companies are raising capital on local stock exchanges to fund projects in specific locations and to help develop the local industry. Prepayment for oil sales and investing in a project in return for shares in the partner company are other ways companies are raising capital to fund energy projects. Private Equity ventures also have an important role to play as investors in certain parts of the value chain. However, capital raising on international markets attracts the attention of a new global audience comprised of shareholders, potential partners, competitors, future host governments and capital providers. This audience, to varying degrees, will demand a level of transparency, and a level of commitment to international financial, industry and regulatory standards of reporting and accountability.', '\xa0-\xa0Brief overview on what the Bank is about: our presence in the oil & gas sector guided by the Bank’s mandate and the newly approved Energy Strategy. -\xa0What we can offer: products, expertise, co-financing mobilization, corporate governance, environmental and sustainability ‘stamp of approval’ - Where we see the potential for the Bank’s financing in the current landscape of the Russian oil & gas sector: o supporting market-oriented sector development through engagement with private players and market infrastructure entities o improvements in corporate governance, transparency and disclosure (EITI and ESIA) standards o non-discriminate third party access (hydrocarbons transportation); o private oilfield service providers and new technologies, innovative technologies in refinery upgrades etc - How the recent shifts in the sector (unconventional oil & gas), converging to spot prices for gas, end of long-term export contracts could affect the business - potentially leading to reorientation towards domestic markets, pre-cursors to more pressure for liberalization, improved TPA to transportation, scope for improvements in institutions, transparency, accountability and commercialization - How we engage with Russian sponsors cross-border in the Bank’s countries of operation I would also like to spend some time on the APG flaring aspect as the Bank has been very active in studying/investing it in Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, as well as potential avenues for carbon credits monetization should the Russian domestic ETS start developing.', 'The projects NR and CD located in two adjacent countries in the interior of Africa are respectively integrated upstream and downstream projects, including E&P of the oilfields, construction and operation of the pipelines and refineries. The results of the preliminary economic evaluation for project NR indicated no good economic benefit. Considering its strategic importance, the operational company integrated it with the project CD, by sharing export pipelines and exchanging oil so as to maximize the economic benefit, forming a consortium. This paper describes an innovative integrated asset methodology, applied for optimizing scenarios where reservoir production profiles, commissioning date, designed throughput and routing of export pipelines, construction of facilities, economy of the whole consortium, and processing capacity of refineries were considered. The consortium consists of 11 sections involving E&P, refineries and pipelines, each of which can be subdivided into several small investment units respectively. Combining with the fiscal terms of all project contracts and the administrative regulations of the two resource-host countries, an innovative link from upstream to downstream economic models was developed for an assisted asset modeling with full life span economic evaluation for the consortium, resulting in fast and liable scenarios evaluation. Each investment unit was evaluated respectively based on the above-mentioned models. According to the interdependency, uniqueness and exclusiveness of the investment units, the commercial rules were regulated, and the investment portfolio analysis method was applied to practical scenarios by using Linear Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm for optimization calculations in order to obtain the maximal internal rate of return (IRR) for the whole consortium. Finally, by considering results of the economic evaluation and investment optimization, the optimal investment portfolio to meet the company’s strategic goals was determined, which provided a basis for the investment optimization decision-making of the company.', 'Decisions to invest or disinvest are the crucial part of petroleum investment projects. Traditional evaluation methods are based on discounted cash flows known to be imprecise. However they are frequently used due to their straightforward view to the problems. Today&#39;s investment decisions are even made in more risky environments with respect to those of previous decades. Irreversibility of such investments demands application of more sophisticated evaluation methods. Real options approach has already been shown to account for uncertainty as well as flexibility and, possibility of having the option to delay to get better information prior to investment. Our study challenges the usage of real options method and machine learning techniques in evaluating investment projects. The performance of machine learning techniques in options valuations has already been shown in previous studies. However these techniques have not been applied to real options analysis yet. The conditions of economic slowdown and incomplete information are also taken into account in our analysis. The initial results indicate that using machine learning techniques in real option analysis is useful yet less time consuming than simulation and lattice methods.', 'With one in five oil refineries expected to cease operations over the next five years, choosing the right operating model and level of integration will be crucial for survival and sustained profitability. Over the next 10 years, operators at one in every three refineries in North America and Western Europe will need to reconsider their operating models and how they are integrated across the value chain. Otherwise, they will struggle to keep up with changing global markets and compete with improving global standards in refining. By 2021, refineries will need to restructure, strategically reposition their assets, or leave the market. These stark prospects are among the findings of our recent study of the global refining market. In North America and Western Europe, the current trend of refinery closings is expected to continue, with one in five refining assets being squeezed out of the market over the next five years. Meanwhile, the boom in demand in Asia and the Middle East will lead to substantial changes in capacity and partnership structures. The conventional wisdom of vertical integration as the ideal and sustainable model for refiners is being challenged. Choosing the right operating model and the required level of integration across the value chain—for each asset and each region—will be crucial for improving margins and sustaining profitability in a volatile market. For assets that are not financially viable, regardless of their model, a decision about whether to exit will need to be made early on to prevent financial losses later in the decade. This paper examines the changes taking place in refining, the value drivers shaping the future of refining, the models available to refiners for different assets and different regions, and the strategies for maximizing value in every region.', 'It is well known that the employment of any crisis management concept is based on the personal preference of the company management, industry specifics of the goods production and distribution, financial health of the company and other factors. It is interesting to analyze not only the methods of traditional conservative concept of crisis management, including cost cutting, recovery of receivables etc., but also the investments of the largest oil and gas companies before the economic crisis and during it. The analysis of investment strategy of capital-intensive oil and gas companies, correlation of the volume of investments with the amount of net profit and dynamics of world prices for oil, demonstrates the relative independence of investments from the prices conjuncture and company profit. It means that the large oil and gas companies use the approaches of evolutionary concept of crisis management, focused on the company development. This policy can speak for the positive stabilization role of energetics during world economic crisis. However, we should mention that because of high capital intensity and long pay-off periods for energy projects, it is impossible to secure rapid substantial grows of supply in the context of growing demand for energy resources, and the considerable increase of prices for energy resources is one of the usual reasons for global economic slowdowns. At various times, world energy crises caused GDP falling in many countries and world economy decline. That is why, in the context of the challenge of new world economic crisis, the commitment of managers of large energy companies to follow the evolutionary concept of crisis management is essential. Thereby, during economic crises it is necessary to promote the work of development institutions (Banks for Development or other organizations established to promote economic growth) on realization of energy projects, to use different forms of private-public partnership (PPP) in order to reduce and share risks during realization of large capital-intensive projects. In particular, availability of production sharing agreements (PSA) and other forms of PPP for large projects helps to increase the long-term anti-crisis stability of oil and gas companies and the government can consider it as the instrument of crisis management, allowing to promote realization of oil and gas projects during periods of economic decline and depression.', 'Nowadays, crude oil is regarded as a financial asset rather than just a consumption commodity. It has a direct role in the world economy and its price fluctuations directly influence future economic growth and planning. Hence, prediction of long-term crude oil price is always one of the most important and challenging issues in oil industry. In the present work, long-term oil price is forecasted. Modeling the price of oil is difficult because of the changing variability over time. The prediction is done on the basis of a hybrid algorithm including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The important effective variables on oil price are collected and then, the long- term prediction is carried out using the new hybrid algorithm. As a hybrid algorithm maintains the advantages of both algorithms, so it can act more successfully. The new hybrid algorithm, in fact, is a PSO algorithm that uses GA operators. This algorithm also applies a fuzzy logic to calculate the probability of each operator. Results show that the proposed algorithm has a good ability to forecast the long-term crude oil price.', '', '', '', 'In overseas E&P projects local content issues become essential quite often. While the company has available resources to finance a new project, it may be faced with local problems of different character slowing or hindering the project. Middle East, South Asia, Latin America and CIS countries have their own particular features and problems. The companies are obliged to use local services and local labor, while at the same time they need to ensure project feasibility and perform in compliance with the best world practices.', 'Dialogue respecting local supplier and workforce participation in petroleum development has evolved in recent years. Discussion of “win/lose” propositions has been replaced by dialogue and policy, reflecting the reality that interests of local communities, governments, NOCs and IOCs are more aligned than different, and in many respects, symbiotic. Effective strategies allow investment to generate broad and sustainable economic development. Undeniable, however, is the growing need to be competitive. Governments and NOCs are focusing on competiveness of workforces, suppliers and taxation regimes. IOCs are seeking efficiency, security of supply and cost reductions in their supply chain and global competitiveness in safety, quality, business conduct and environmental protection. Increasingly, stakeholders recognize short-term thinking and last minute planning will yield sub-optimal results. Countries optimizing for success are focusing on workforce and supplier capacity development years in advance and at a realistic and sustainable pace. Further, there is an enhanced understanding that a successful approach in one location may not work in another, even when underlying differences are not discernible. Finally, respecting the need to be competitive, countries on the leading edge of this debate are carefully considering the risks and costs of complex and prescriptive local content policies, taking a more supportive and collaborative position. Russia, Malaysia and Canada have all realized significant successes in supplier and workforce development spurred by their Oil and Gas Sectors, and while there are similarities in their approaches, there are also differences. Analysis of their approaches to National Content reveals lessons for those about to embark on this journey and those adapting their strategies in response to dynamic shifts in the market as well as the socio-economic environment. However, the real lesson is that in a fast-paced and highly competitive global economy, stakeholders that embrace “continuous improvement”, adapt quickly and are grounded by understanding the value of collaborative relationship in a competitive environment, will reap the rewards and allow the supply of energy for years to come.', 'Across the world the “new resource” owners are looking for significant investments from joint venture partners in the broader development of their economies. The expectation is evident in the following examples: · Brazil – “Contractual commitment of purchasing local goods and services on a competitive basis with the objective of developing local suppliers and technology and increasing employment and income growth.” · Nigeria – “ Nigerian content means the quantum of composite value added to or created in the Nigerian economy by a systematic development of capacity and capabilities through the deliberate utilization of Nigerian human, material resources and services in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.” · Saudi Arabia - LC is defined as the value added or created in the Saudi economy through the utilization of in-Kingdom human and material resources in the provision of goods and/or services. In bidding for and executing the capital project joint venture partners’ seek to fulfil local content expectations through a variety of opportunities. These include the use of local workforce, local suppliers for goods and services, and investments into the social infrastructure e.g. schools, roads, hospitals, railways etc. Based on Accenture’s capital project research, experiences and roles in supporting clients in the execution of capital projects, Accenture has developed a Local Content framework which spans strategy definition to implementation. Using this framework Accenture will share with the audience its perspectives on the maturity of local content capability, the value orientation of local content programs and the performance of contractors in meeting local content expectations and hence securing the supply of equipment, materials and local content infrastructure. Accenture will be able to draw examples from the Middle East, Nigeria, Canada, Australia, Brazil and South Africa. This paper is aimed at oil and gas senior executives that are responsible for the defining, implementing and monitoring local content strategies.', 'Consistent with Shell General Business Principles, Shell Companies in Iraq will seek to maximise in a sustainable manner, the use of Iraqi human resources, materials, equipment and services in its operations. Shell is committed to re-engineer key supply chains to enhance and sustain Local Content and create greater benefit to the economic development of Iraq. Local content refers to in-country value created by the utilization of Iraqi goods, services and human resources. Shell’s primary objectives for developing local content are to: · Contribute to the socio-economic growth and development of Iraqi society and local communities to achieve a mutually beneficial environment for carrying out oil and gas operations, while complying with applicable local laws, regulations or guidelines. · Identify opportunities and demand requirements within our supply chain for local goods and services, and improve the capacity and capability of the Iraqi people and businesses to participate in our activities, in order to achieve sustainable commercial and industrial benefits for both parties, over the full project or venture life cycle – from design and planning to execution and operations phases. · Increase Iraqi companies’ awareness of Shell’s contracting policies, standards, and expectations, and explore areas of synergy or partnerships between foreign and Iraqi companies to support development of Iraqi capacity in identified categories. These objectives will be pursued without compromising Shell Group Business Principles, Quality, Health, Safety, Environmental Standards and any regulatory requirements. In order to maximize the opportunities for participation of local companies and citizens in our business the Local Content scope shall include: · Local Procurement and Services – The procurement of local available materials and services. · Local Workforce Development – Improving the capacity and capability of the Iraqi people through education and training in relevant skill areas. · Local Employment – The direct and indirect hiring and development of our Iraq venture staff and national personnel of our contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. · Local Business Capacity Development – Supporting local industry initiatives to promote Local Content development in order to secure long-term sustainable commercial benefits for Shell. This scope will be pursued in consultation and partnership with all relevant stakeholders. Measurement: Performance on Local Content shall be measured and reported on an annual basis.', 'The landscape for upstream oil and gas companies is shifting at an unprecedented pace. The production of conventional sources of oil and gas is relocating to more remote, difficult, and expensive parts of the globe, such as ultra-deepwater, and to the Arctic. This inevitably leads to higher project costs and higher risk on capital returns. To preserve profitability in these challenging times, oil and gas companies must maintain operational efficiencies while minimizing risks. With this in mind, materials management is a hidden gold mine for many upstream companies—a wealth of value waiting to be discovered. Upstream companies have long pursued the latest strategies to improve profits. They renegotiated contracts with service companies, applied strategic sourcing to reduce equipment costs, and improved maintenance activities to reduce costs and turnaround times. Few companies, however, have spent time or effort on optimizing materials management. A primary focus has historically been on availability of materials for production or projects rather than costs. This trend was driven by risk aversion, lack of tracking systems, and complicated supply chains, with a variety of parties involved in both the operations of existing assets and the execution of capital projects. Making necessary materials available for production sites and projects is vital, as costs of a missed day of production or delay in the first oil date are significant. But there is also an opportunity to reduce the costs of running the assets or executing capital projects without compromising availability. This study shows that there are three main areas in which companies can create value by improving materials management: logistics costs, waste, and capital tied up in stock.', 'Supply chain performance is a measure of competitive advantage—both immediate and long term. Not so long ago, the life of a supply chain executive seemed easy: The main objectives were to be cost effective and provide high-quality service. Then all sorts of innovative technologies, ideas, and concepts were introduced to help improve performance. Companies centralized their supply chain organizations, brought in expensive enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, and outsourced manufacturing and distribution to bigger and more capable third parties. Yet despite these and other measures, supply chain performance from a cost and service perspective declined, stalled, or saw minimal improvements. Suggestions on how to improve supply chain performance abound in industry magazines and journals, with most proposing solutions such as becoming more customer-centric, responsive, and agile. Nice words, but few people seem to know exactly what they mean or how to turn them into actions. Today, CEOs and supply chain executives continue to ask important questions: How do we control mounting complexity? How can we balance size and efficiency with flexibility and responsiveness? Is it possible to plan for demand volatility? Which of the many companies in our supply chains should be our closest and most trusted partners? Answering these questions requires taking a closer look at the pressures on today&#39;s supply chains, the different improvement measures available, and the reasons why companies often fail to take the appropriate measures. By aligning supply chain objectives with overall business objectives, companies not only improve performance and competitive advantage, but also have a supply chain that can carry them into the future. Winning supply chains integrate today&#39;s supply chain capabilities with tomorrow&#39;s goals.', 'The Strait of Hormuz is of strategic importance to the world as around 20 million barrels or almost 20% of the world’s traded oil on average transit daily through these straits. What about the majority of the barrels that are processed or controlled through IT infrastructure? How secure are the operations of Oil & Gas Industry to safely provide energy to the world, un-interrupted? The Oil & Gas industry becomes increasingly dependent on information and communication technology. Advances in computing – including in-memory processing of data, virtualization of infrastructures and mobility – accelerate performance by factors of hundreds and provide computing and storage resources that scale to the actual demand. Results that were previously only available with long processing time, become now accessible in real-time at the place where they are needed, leading to vast economic advantages. However, to exploit these advantages, an increased focus on security is necessary: recent events have shown that IT systems, applications and networks can be vulnerable. The key to the power of the new computing paradigms is distribution and sharing, which tend to increase the attack surface. Data processing and storage are outsourced to specialized providers hosting a multitude of tenants, thus more likely to show vulnerabilities. In this presentation, we share our experience on how IT security risk can be managed in the Oil & Gas business, and present new approaches that allow benefiting from advanced IT including processing of sensitive data. We discuss process and organizational means as well as solutions. In particular, we focus on novel research results that use advanced cryptography to support the execution of operations directly on encrypted data, which eliminates the need to share keys with data processors and leaves clear text data unseen and untouched by any other entity than the data owner.', 'The Issue The oil and gas industry operates in complex environments; political and social instability is a feature of many resource-rich countries, resulting in potential security issues in companies’ areas of operation. It is therefore imperative that the industry conducts business in a responsible way. Companies face challenges in producing and transporting oil/gas supplies safely and reliably when there are major, chronic disruptions often triggered by poverty, conflict, labour unrest, lack of access to basic human needs, and other social factors. These potential issues can cause costly delays, and affect the livelihoods of local populations, employees, and contractors. It is critical for business success to address potential security issues by implementing responsible security methodologies in order to ensure the safety and sustainability of the operating environment. An enabling environment that protects the population and prevents disruptions to operations also recognizes that there are mutual benefits to managing impacts and contributing to the social and economic development of the local communities. This includes promoting opportunities through local content and capacity building, social investment and access to affordable and safe energy. The Project From 2013-2014 IPIECA is facilitating an industry effort to develop practical, field-level guidance on security and human rights. This will be accomplished through peer-learning workshops to exchange good practices and result in the production of guidance and tools for the industry. Workshops include the focus areas: i) Managing Public and Private Security (MOUs, vetting and selection, equipment transfers, and training); ii) Creating Foundations for Responsible Security (governance, risk assessments, community engagement); and iii) Responding to Incidents and Establishing Assurance (incident management, reporting and investigation, role of management systems, role of third parties). In addition to the three focus areas, case studies based on real-world scenarios are being developed to further stimulate discussion amongst workshop participants about the challenges and opportunities surrounding the implementation of responsible security operations. The Outcome Early learning from these workshops will be presented at WPC as an initial step towards the production of final guidance later in 2014.', 'Intricate nature of the upstream supply chain is fraught with risks and uncertainties. The complexity in the convoluted processes of the extraction, logistics and storage etc in upstream petroleum establish immense challenges in respect of risk mitigation and supply chain optimization. The significant risks at micro and macro-economic level of investment in upstream emanates from the deployment of composite plants having highly automated infrastructures / processes and systems like drilling rigs, offshore platforms and transport equipment which are critical to this industry. This paper applies Analytical Hierarchy Process in a multi-criteria domain to model risk management in the decision support systems in the geographically diverse topology in Indian context. Included in the key findings are that the focal areas of Transportation and E&P need to be managed with the risk either through internalization or through sharing of risk with the supply chain partners.', 'Barzan Project is a unique and challenging Construction Project that is being executed in Ras Laffan Industrial City in Qatar. The Project manpower during peak exceeds 25,000 workers which make for a lot of different behaviors and cultures, which can have a big impact on the overall safety performance of the Project. Developing a strong safety culture during construction execution, at the mega project of workers from multiple nationalities with Behaviour Observation and Intervention (BO&I) program supported by Incident and injury free (IIF) program encourages building personnel relationships. Observers, trained in observation and intervention techniques, observe workers, with regards to “at-risk” but also “safe” behaviors and intervene immediately by either coaching and correcting or appreciating the person observed. Coaching and correcting takes place confidentially, but appreciation is carried out publicly to motivate safe behavior in others. The data gathered is recorded in a database and a quarterly BO&I trend analysis report provides a clear understanding of the level of safety culture developed on the Project. Awareness has risen amongst the entire workforce. The BO&I Logo is widely recognized and associated with the Program. The Quarterly BO&I Trend Analysis Report indicates critical trends and the analysis suggest further course of actions. A clear understanding of “Behaviour Based Safety” has been achieved site wide. Barzan Project has developed and implemented an excellent behavior based safety program that has great and positive impact on Barzan’s overall safety culture. Considering the large number of personnel and manhours, the positive safety culture and behavior change will significantly contribute to incident, accident and personal injury prevention. The fact that this project has achieved 75 milion manhours without an Lost Time Incident proves the robustness of using IIF combined with a good BO&I Program.', 'This paper explores the tremendous developments that have taken place since the start-up of offshore oil and gas exploration more than 65 years ago. Throughout these years, the industry has gained extensive operational experience and, from this, learned valuable lessons about how to enhance safety and environmental performance. New and improved technical solutions have been developed and, operational systems and regulations were developed to support a wide variety of oil and gas developments. Operating practices have been tested and refined to unlock a wide variety of oil and gas resources within increasingly advanced regulatory frameworks. Despite these achievements, major accidents and near-miss incidents continue to occur. The paper notes the overall challenges of the exploration and production business in ensuring safety and reliability. Offshore oil and gas exploration and production activities are complex activities that require the handling of large amounts of pressurised hydrocarbons and other produced fluids and gases, some sour and extremely poisonous, in a dynamic maritime environment. History shows that major offshore accidents have occurred on all of the world’s continental shelves, resulting in loss of lives, damage to the environment and destruction of assets. A substantial amount of the world&#39;s remaining oil and gas reserves is believed to yet to be developed offshore. We are heading into deeper waters, more remote locations, increasingly challenging reservoirs, harsher environments and more environmentally sensitive areas. These trends introduce new risks that need to be understood and managed. Based on the key learnings from major offshore accidents from all major oil and gas frontiers, the paper offer ways to improve offshore safety and environmental performance above current levels and, in particular, suggests ways to prevent and mitigate major accidents. In addition, the paper addresses some key principles which need a special focus.', 'The oil and natural gas industry and the federal government have together taken great strides to improve the safety of offshore drilling operations since the Macondo incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Immediately following the incident, the U.S. oil and natural gas industry launched a comprehensive review of offshore safety and operations to identify potential improvements in spill prevention, intervention and response capabilities. Four joint industry task forces were assembled to focus on the critical areas of equipment, operating procedures, subsea well control and oil spill response. The task forces also worked with U.S. Department of the Interior and the Presidential Oil Spill Commission to help form their recommendations to improve offshore safety and the regulatory framework. These Industry recommendations will be presented. Additionally, post-Macondo reports contain strong recommendations on the need for the Federal government to collaborate with national and international Standards Development Organizations and the offshore oil and gas community in developing new standards and updating existing standards. The presentation will outline the new standards and regulations in place including: API Standard 53 Blowout Prevention Equipment Systems for Drilling Operations; API Standard 65-2 Isolating Potential Flow Zones During Well Construction; API RP 96 Deepwater Well Design and Construction; API Bulletin 97 Well Construction Interface Document Guidelines; API RP 17W Recommended Practice for Subsea Capping Stacks , API Spec 16A Specification for Drill-through Equipment ; and API RP 17H Remotely Operated Tools and Interfaces on Subsea Production Systems.', 'KOC commenced Integrity Management (IM) System implementation in 2003. The IM system implementation sits under HSE umbrella and compliments the existing HSE management system policy and procedures. Company operational assets include Wells, Flowlines, Gathering Centres, Booster Stations, Pipelines corridors, Tank Farms, Export & Marine Facilities. Inspection & Corrosion activities involve RBI (Risk Based Inspection) of static equipment and also RCM (Reliability Centred Maintenance) of rotating machinery. Initially, a set of six critical areas for IM implementation was agreed with the operating assets and KPIs (key performance indicators) were defined accordingly. These comprised of chemical management system, safety critical equipment, emergency shutdown system testing, fire & gas detection system, replacement of pipelines temporary clamps with permanent ones and procedure for control & monitoring of safety overrides equipment. Previous integrity related incidents were analysed to identify the immediate and root causes and a basket of IM KPIs was prepared accordingly. The analysis also included the minor incidents, near misses, unsafe acts & conditions and lessons learned from inside and other Oil & Gas companies. Each asset selected a number of KPIs as applicable to the nature of their operations and prepared a 3 years rolling plan accordingly. Each asset monitors implementation of their selected KPIs and quarterly performance reports are compiled in an auditable manner. Achieved KPI targets are sustained for continuous improvement cycle & new KPIs are introduced into the IM basket as/when identified. IM system has now focused on PSM (process safety management) related goals / objectives and incident prevention. Although the HSE management system has been focused on personal safety, IM/PSM system is aiming to enhance the process safety and prevent PSM related incidents. This provides a more holistic approach to enhance accountabilities, responsibilities, competency development, safety critical equipment identification & respective PM (preventive maintenance) plans and incorporation of Inherently Safer Design (ISD) principles in project concepts to prevent loss of containment and ensure sustainable management of company facilities operations.', 'The keystone to enhancing safety performance is balancing the improvement of organizational culture with the optimization of management systems. This technical paper and presentation will highlight ExxonMobil’s latest efforts to improve safety performance by simultaneously demonstrating a culture of caring and involvement with the utilization of management systems to assure effectiveness. Safety starts with embracing a “hurt free” incident approach that recognizes and builds upon the idea that not only can we work “hurt free” for a brief moment in time, but we can extend those moments to days, and then weeks, and then even years. To achieve a “hurt free” environment the whole organization, from senior executives in the home office to the workers at the front line, has to demonstrate a passionate commitment to safety where working safe is more than simply an expectation, it is the norm. Working safe, and ultimately “hurt free,” has to be reflected in the hearts and minds of the entire workforce. Consistent “hurt free” safety performance requires a balance between establishing a safety culture characterized by passion and caring and one that also leverages the benefits of a systems approach. Workplace hazards can best be identified, assessed, and addressed using a systems approach. A systems approach provides the structure, discipline, and consistency needed to facilitate planning, communication, and execution at a level beyond individual personal experiences. While a safety culture characterized by passion and caring makes the safety program effective, a systems approach to safety provides efficiency and consistency. Safety systems by themselves are not effective; without a safety culture that demonstrates care for and among the workers, the safety system just ends up being another file in the computer. The technical paper and subsequent presentation will demonstrate the effectiveness of a balanced approach by reflecting on experiences and results of the Sakhalin projects.', 'Our industry continues to develop oil and gas reserves on the continental shelf off northeast Sakhalin Island, Okhotsk Sea, Russia. These projects are located in proximity to a habitat used by the Korean-Okhotsk or Western North Pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus), hereafter referred to as the Western Gray Whale (WGW). The WGW population is listed as endangered in the Russian Red Book and as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Recognizing the sensitivity of the population, a joint industry program was initiated to focus on protection and conservation through research, monitoring, and mitigation. The program has resulted in one of the most comprehensive datasets on marine mammal ecology and anthropogenic impacts at both the individual and population levels. The dataset led to the development and implementation of mitigation plans to address major risks to the population and, through a recent tagging and satellite-monitored telemetry effort, provided important insights into Pacific basin-scale movements of the population. In addition, International collaborations with leading research institutions have been established to analyze genetic, hormone and isotope data from tissue samples and to validate acoustic disturbance and impact models at the population level. Results from these studies will be used to further reduce risks to the population, and can be applied to other sensitive Arctic regions and species. The presentation provides (1) An overview of initial studies and protection plans to address WGW ecological data gaps and risks to the population; (2) Summary results of the joint monitoring program, (3) Results from a tagging and satellite-monitored telemetry project to better assess the risks to the WGW population across its annual life cycle, and (4) A description of cutting-edge research and modeling efforts to address impacts created by both acute and chronic disturbances.', 'Crude oil delivery expectations under timeline constraints necessitated simultaneous operations (SIMOPS) for completing sour field development requirements close to the Arabian Gulf. During the SIMOPS different sub-organizations coordinated potentially different, yet complimentary operations or activities in the same location together. Challenges from the exercise included instituting an interface criteria for promoting safe operations and good technical standards for all parties. After considering work requirements, a SIMOPS team facilitated an assessment review, devised a response framework with rescue, evacuation, or emergency response plans in the event of accidental release of H2S, besides certain other modifications to satisfy multiple stakeholders. An auditable matrix was instituted for regulating and supporting permissible simultaneous rigless and construction activities while upholding health, safety, and the environment. The scope of this paper is to show how SIMOPS was successfully planned, executed, and managed for the first time in Causeway drill sites in Saudi Aramco to manage disasters and secure the asset team from surprises arising from a possible failure to meet tests or tie-in objectives. The approach involved delineating clear reporting lines or control hierarchy for various stages of operation, avoiding schedule clashes by outlining clear scenarios for each organization. Guidelines were binding for all team members because of collaboration among multidisciplinary team members to develop suitable hazards identification and risk management plans thus formulating the foundations of SIMOPS and ensuring safety of workers. SIMOPS facilitated the unlocking of the giant field’s potential while optimizing potentially conflicting but complimentary activities on the same drill site to meet crude demand reliably and safely. Success with SIMOPS has allowed oil production delivery from the field and safe working environment for crews. SIMOPS provided reliable plans in place and means to achieve well clean up, test, stimulation goals, and tie-in readiness ahead of the on-stream milestones for wells on Causeway drill sites.', 'As part of an intensive effort in Flare Minimisation, a dedicated team classified the cause and the source of flaring to identify potential areas for flare reduction initiatives. Approximately 30% of the total flaring was from unknown points, considered likely originating from leaking valves to the flare header. Effort has been made to further zoom-in to identify the individual source of leaking. It is a challenging task as huge facilities having at least 10,000 items venting source varying from control valves, relief valves, manual drain/ vent valves to emergency blow down system that directly tied to flare header. Some have limited justification to stop plant operation for the inspection purpose. Some are having long waits for the next scheduled shutdown inspection or not having enough justification to extend shutdown time due to large number of items for inspection. Some of them have no inspection opportunity, due to common facilities location. These complexities and challenges lead to an idea to utilise indirect methods of inspection. One possible method was use of acoustic technology. This technology works through leak prediction via leak hissing sounds that are good enough to differentiate from other sounds created by other non-related sources. This method was theoretically promising to RasGas in qualifying and locating the passing valve and the important thing was that surveys can be done whilst the plant is running. This presentation will explain the effort in conducting the passing survey, the expectation, the prediction the total number of items, the strategy, the survey finding, the implementation and the lessons learned.', 'In December 2009, ORYX GTL’s Chief Executive Officer Abdulrahman Al-Suwaidi initiated ORYX GTL’s safety culture transformation programme, “Road to Zero Harm Campaign” with a primary objective to introduce and embed the companywide-shared value of “Safety is Our Way of Life”. At the time, the company had a Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) of 0.62. In August 2012, ORYX GTL reached a TRIR of Zero, which has been maintained throughout a total facility turnaround in February and March 2013. This turnaround represented about 1.8 million man-hours of work and was our first turnaround with a zero TRIR. ORYX GTL does not see this as the final destination of our safety journey, but as a milestone on a continuous journey. Following a variety of activities and changes in our practices we now face a new opportunity to go “Beyond Zero Harm”. Our senior management was all committed to making this a reality which they matched with a willingness to do whatever is required. ORYX GTL views Beyond Zero Harm as an opportunity to move away from controlling safety to assuring safety. This behavior change involves all stakeholders of the company; we acknowledge that we have reached Zero TRIR through the rigors of a robust safety control system. Going Beyond Zero is not about implementing a more robust safety control system, but rather transferring its ownership from HSE practices to the whole company including our contractors. HSE can then focus on assuring the controls applied. This paper will present the planning and implementation of a 5-point strategy over a period of 3 years to reach the milestone target: detailed strategies, detailed plans, detailed measurement, leadership and celebrating success. It will provide practical examples of initiatives implemented in the organization, and a roadmap on the journey ahead.', 'Human factors are the main cause of most of the accidents in the drilling industry. These factors are related to the relationship of humans with each other, with working environment, tools, procedures and organization. Drilling operations are procedural. The high level of interaction between workers, software and hardware in these operations makes them complex. The probability of human error and accidents in complex systems is high. In addition to loss of lives and property, accidents in offshore drilling rigs results in pollution of marine environments. These all are threats for the reputation of drilling companies. Analysis and assessment of human factors can reduce the number of human errors and the rate of accidents. In this paper the different techniques used for analysis of human factors will be surveyed. Based on the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques, and also regarding the complexity and nature of offshore drilling operation, a proper algorithm for analysis and assessment of risks arising from human factors in offshore drilling activities will be introduce.', 'Following the Horizon incident in the US Gulf of Mexico there has been both a US and worldwide renewed focus on promoting the highest level of safety for the offshore oil and gas industry. Based on Horizon reports and regulatory changes, the recent focus in the US has been on both enhancing and developing performance based Safety and Environmental Management Systems (SEMS) that are assessed by auditing. SEMS should be a sustainable learning system that continuously enhances and improves both itself and a good safety culture. In the US, the Center for Offshore Safety (COS) was formed to collaboratively develop SEMS effectiveness tools. The COS is based on the US Presidential Commission recommendations and SEMS studies by the industry. The formation, operation, and results of COS will be presented including the SEMS effectiveness tools for leadership site engagement, data base and analysis, auditing, audit and auditor certification and training, safety performance indicators, learning from incidents, and skills and knowledge development and assurance. Lastly, the plans and programs of COS to continue SEMS enhancement into the future will be presented. The conclusions of the paper include: 1) SEMS must be a continuous learning process based on the analysis of safety audit results, safety indicators, and learning from incidents data, 2) A collaborative environment and process can develop good SEMS tools, 3) SEMS is a sound foundation for enhancing safety culture, 4) Good safety culture should appropriately consider both individual safety and system safety, 5) SEMS must be driven by leadership, 6) Use of the safety barrier concept is a useful tool for identifying safety performance indicators and enhancing skills and knowledge.', 'In the Oil and Gas Industry, as well as in many other industries, the traditional approach to manage safety has been of the prescriptive compliance type, based on the adherence to a set of standards and procedures describing how to achieve an acceptable level of risk. However more recently, the new tendency in managing safety has shifted to a performance based approach based on requirements that describe only what level of safety must be achieved without imposing the means to achieve the targets. As its name implies, performance-based regulation in safety is an approach that focuses on performance and objectives. This concept is not new in other industries such for example in the nuclear industry and offers several advantages in respect to prescriptive based regulation since it allows the individuals to choose how to meet these objectives. However this type of approach to manage safety, works well when actual performance can be measured, evaluated, and verified. For this reason it is crucial to define measurable objective and observable parameters which exist or can be developed to assess performance. This paper presents a new program developed within the company based on the definition of Safety Key Performance Indicators KPI (both leading and lagging indicators) for the performance measurement and management aimed at monitoring and enhancing safety performance across the company business units worldwide. The paper explores the pros and the cons of the performance based approach for safety, and describes the improvement in safety performance achieved through the implementation of the program. It also discusses the need to embed KPIs within the organization through their effective communication and full understanding as the key to maximize their added value.', 'The Deep water Horizon disaster demanded a massive response that had never been experienced before, and dramatically proved the need to enhance requirements for Oil Spill preparedness and Emergency Response. The Macondo aftermath proved once again the need to have a proactive instead of reactive approach. It is therefore necessary to combine lessons learnt from previous incidents with latest technologies to elaborate more accurate oil spill modeling tools able to predict possible spill scenarios and arrange flawless emergency Response and Oil spill Management. The need to have expeditive methodologies is also driven by the new set of international and local regulations that has been established soon after Macondo. In the US the Post Macondo Regulatory Response has led to new prescriptive rules for deepwater drilling having significant impact on drilling engineering, operations: In Europe in June 2013 the EU adopted a Directive on safety of offshore oil and gas operations. The new directive foresees that all operators shall demonstrate to have access to sufficient physical, human and financial resources to promptly react to severe accidents, prove to be aware of the extent of potential liabilities resulting from oil spills, and provide evidence that all necessary provisions have already been, or will be made, to cover them. This becomes particularly challenging for operations in sensitive areas: in fact increasing hydrocarbon demand pushes operators towards unconventional deposits and higher-risk and remote areas characterized by social and environmental sensitivities where emergency response and Oil spill preparedness become very difficult. This paper describes one of the initiatives undertaken within our company to comply with new regulations: the development of a semi quantitative methodology to assess the risk of Blow Out and the release from pipelines combined with a Bow tie approach for the identification of preventive and recovery barriers which can further reduce frequency of the event or mitigate their consequences.', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'As dynamics in the business environment increased and in the present volatile market, contracting organizations across the globe face risks on various fronts both at strategic and operational levels, which threaten their sustainability.This necessitates a formal/structured risk management approach at enterprise level, to ensure business sustainability by minimizing surprises and making unknowns to knowns.

The Peruvian gas industry –a fledgling one in that period– was forced to devise financial mechanisms in order to get its development. One of them, perhaps the most important, was the creation of the ""Main Transportation and Distribution Pipelines Guarantee"" (GRP, as its acronym in Spanish). GRP is a financial tool to ensure the annual income of investors in the transportation and distribution of natural gas. This is an additional payment made by energy customers for the shortfall that might exist between an expected income and an income that is guaranteed by the transportation and distribution of natural gas concession contracts, to adequately reward the cost of service of the concessionaires. GRP reduces the investment risk of transportation and distribution gas service and makes it possible the development of the gas industry. It would not have been possible to install Peruvian main transportation and distribution pipelines such as “Camisea” project if GRP had not been created. Even if “Camisea” had been concluded, the price of gas transportation service would have been high and the costs of power plants (pipeline main customers) would have increased, with a consequent impact on electricity prices and the failure of gas industry. GRP is all a Peruvian regulatory conception. It will make possible future projects that will provide energy access to the poorest regions in the country. Based on its key role played in Peru, the proposed paper will expose how the GRP works, the agents who are required to pay it and, as a conclusion, why it is so important for the economic development and energy access."', 'The São Francisco Basin is a Proterozoic basin, located in central Brazil, covering parts of Bahia, Minas Gerais and Goiás States, on the São Francisco craton. The basin embraces an area of about 350.000 km² (135.000 square miles), greater than Marcellus formation in US. But differently from the former basin mentioned, São Francisco basin is a new frontier, and its true development started only in 2005, when Brazilian Regulatory Agency promoted the 7 th Round, when an area of about 99.000 km² were granted for exploration, added to other 22.000 km 2 on the 10 th round in 2008. Since then, some companies have undertaken E&P activities to better understand the geology of the basin which, according to the first results, will be very challenging, considering the resources available tend to be unconventional ones. This possibility implies in many issues, the operators in the basin have to face, ranging from technology, needed to explore the natural gas, to environmental concerns that will certainly arise, once hydraulic fracture is already a worldwide preoccupation. Moreover, the infrastructure surrounding the areas of exploration is to be developed, once natural gas market in Brazil is under developed, being concentrated mainly in the coast. This demands a public-private effort in order to create a reasonable set of regulation, fiscal incentives and public policy to attract investors to develop this industry in a new frontier basin. The purpose of this paper is to present the challenging issues already identified to develop the São Francisco basin, and the initiatives started by companies and government ahead of time to address risks involved and create favorable conditions to foster E&P activities in the region, including proposals for R&D projects to bring the right technology, alternatives to finance infrastructure development, regulatory and environmental discussions on the way among all stakeholders.', '“If you don’t get the balance right between the companies’ interest and the country’s interest, the country ultimately will lose.”\xa0\xa0 -William Ramsay The concept of this paper comes from the fact that there are multiple standards followed in various regulatory issues throughout the world. Often it is observed that various countries have various practices which lead to either loss of precious energy or the perfect utilization of it. Taking a cue from the above, this paper will try to document the various practices that major countries in energy follows. The documentation will serve as a catalog of what should be implemented and what should be avoided in context of best practice that should be followed in the Energy Sector, thus serving the purpose of the paper. Narrowing down the Geo – Political Spectrum, the paper will focus on governance, risks and compliance of four oil major countries namely Russia, United States of America, Saudi Arabia and Brazil. The countries selected are from a diverse set of background both economic and geo- political. Further the study will be using PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Economic) analysis in bringing out the various best practices that is aimed in reducing the loss of precious energy. The paper will be mostly based on secondary research and the research methodology will be primarily qualitative in nature. Finally to conclude, the paper will examine how to develop the best possible practices in the given domain, so that all the stake holders related to an energy sector gets into a win-win situation, making the key aim of the paper.', 'Asset integrity is a critical aspect of the oil and gas sector where safety and reliability become first priority to operate and maintain the plant. A spreadsheet tool (Fixed Asset Integrity Meter) has been developed to quantify the asset integrity in a plant based on several related criteria and provide an objective and numerical values rather than subjective judgment. The developed meter is proven to be a motivating tool for plant proponent, to increase the asset integrity of a plant by adhering to applicable engineering standards and procedure.', 'REACH is a regulation of the European Union (European Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)), which is legally binding on all member countries of the EU or importer companies, established outside of the EU. REACH regulation means significant tasks for the oil industry, since the regulation radically transformed the responsibilities of industry and of the authorities for the control of chemicals. The chemical legislation establishes procedures for collecting and assessing information on the properties and hazards of substances, and adopted to improve the protection from potential chemical risks. It requires that all substances manufactured in or imported into the European Union need to be registered, otherwise production, import and placing on the market will be no longer possible. REACH has an impact on the whole development, production and sales process: without compliance with REACH regulation, related substances (e.g. most of oil and petrochemical products) shall not be manufactured and imported, and high penalties can be expected from local authorities. Consequently, the so-called REACH compliance is an important co-operative task of MOL Group, in which all legal entities (e.g. MOL, INA, Slovnaft, IES, MOL-LUB) take part. MOL Group has registered 169 substances (2010: 165, 2013: 4) until the defined deadlines (2010, 2013). In our case study handling of relevant processes (pre-registration, registration, our Lead Registrant roles, PPORD notifications, SVHC-related tasks, etc.), main challenges and compliance experiences of MOL are presented. It gives brief review about the regulation, which holds and probably will hold significant challenges for MOL Group, similarly to other oil industrial companies from both upstream and downstream side.', 'Many LNG producers have expressed interest in establishing liaison offices in their key customer markets. In doing so, producers are building a strong customer focus and relationships. The poster session will examine the Buyer-seller partnerships and analyzes the experiences with liaison offices in the three regions: Japan, China and Houston. The poster further examines key features of the liaison offices in these countries, including the reasons for their creation, the means of establishment, the input from local bodies in the process, the structure and organization of the offices, the evolution over time of interactions between Qatargas and Buyers, and the main challenges and opportunities that the offices encounter in promoting buyer-seller cooperation. Since the inception of Qatargas, we have established liaison offices throughout LNG markets in order to generate presence within our markets as well as properly brand our Company name. The intent of our liaison offices is to provide our customers instant access to QG. Our anchor Japanese LNG buyers have required this process of their seller’s since the evolution of the business in Japan. We have taken this concept and applied it in other markets. To date we have three liaison offices, one in Japan, one in China and one in USA. Based on Qatargas’ global presence, our liaison offices comply with local business laws and provide an effective communication link with our LNG counterparts.', 'Despite the uncertainty in the current global economic environment, the continued imposition of taxes on income from oil and gas operations remains a certainty. Oil and gas is spread around the globe, and resource-rich countries are competing with each other both for international and domestic investments. Forward-thinking governments are constantly working on making oil and gas tax regimes attractive to investors. On one hand, oil and gas companies make up a significant source of state revenues around the world, on the other, the tax burden, or the government take, is very important for oil and gas companies as its level and its characteristics (e.g. the timing, revenue- versus profit-based features) directly affects the project’s profitability. Oil and gas continue to be discovered both in frontier and mature producing countries. In search for investments into exploration and potential new projects many governments are offering special terms for the new acreages (e.g. contractual regime in contract to concessions, lower royalties/special taxes, higher flexibility for profit sharing). Most producing countries are facing the declining production on brown fields and the governments are addressing this issue in their tax and fiscal policies to support investors and extend the economical life of fields. Development of unconventional oil and gas, shale oil and gas in particular, is economically possible under current oil prices. Many countries see it as a policy objective and are working on altering their tax and fiscal framework to provide incentives for such projects which could reshape the investments into new projects towards capital intense unconventional hydrocarbons. The fiscal environment for oil and gas industry is constantly changing around the globe. This paper would discuss global taxation trends in 2012/2013/2014, highlighting major legislative changes which occurred in countries with respect to overall tax burden and those relating to specific projects (conventional onshore/offshore, unconventional oil and gas).', 'Inclusion of assessments with respect to noise exposure, audiometry and development of noise footprints as terms of reference for carrying out Environmental Impact Assessment studies by statutory authorities in India, brought a new dimension towards sustainable management of human health. The development of a noise footprint involves an initial survey for identification of monitoring locations, determination of representative sampling days, monitoring, plotting of noise contours and interlinking with audiometric results. This poster shall portray the noise footprint of an Indian petroleum refinery developed by the authors. In order to assess the extent of noise pollution within the refinery and at the periphery, a survey was carried out to identify 300 strategic locations around various noise generating sources. Noise levels were monitored at these locations both daytime and night time. The same has been mapped and noise contours are plotted for the entire area of the refinery complex. It has been found that the ambient noise levels at the boundary wall of the refinery due to existing refinery operations are even conforming to the permissible residential area noise limits of 55 dB(A) for daytime and 45 dB(A) for night time as per Indian Environmental (Protection) Act and Rules. The maximum noise level at the boundary due to noise transmission from the refinery operations alone is found to be around 40 dB. Parallel audiometric tests were carried out for 58 personnel working at various locations within the refinery complex. It has been observed that some of the personnel working around heavy noise generating equipment were diagnosed with either sensor neural/ mixed hearing loss or severe Conductive type hearing loss in both ears. A strategy is formulated based on the results and further mitigation measures were implemented. These include installation of acoustic hoods, increasing green cover by planting additional 5000 trees/plants/climbers.', 'There is a whole range of important energy policy documents that has been approved by Chinese government recently. One of the most important is the 12th Five-Year Plan for Energy Development. This document summarizes China’s major achievements in energy development during the 11th Five-Year Plan and sets out key development objectives for the industry till 2015. The paper mentions the existing binding intensity and non-fossil energy targets, in addition to providing details on China’s aspirations with regards to limiting energy intensity of the economy and growing China’s energy production and distribution infrastructure. The current situation in energy sectors and the path for future reforms are best explained in White paper “Energy policy of China”. The document mentions the importance of energy conservation and domestic production and at the same time stresses the need to conduct energy sectors’ reforms and develop international cooperation. Those two documents complement each other and provide a comprehensive view on Chinese domestic energy policy. Noteworthy they are released only in Chinese which makes them unbeknown in the western world. But there is a report that encompasses the Chinese and World energy situation and that is also released in English. It is called China Energy Outlook (on the intentional analogy with World Energy Outlook). The report represents “Chinese version of the truth” and comprises of a short term outlook to 2015 (that was published in 2012) and a long term outlook to 2050 (which is to be published in 2013). Taken together those reports represent a comprehensive view on Chinese energy industry and its future. The author will summarize most significant developments of Chinese energy policy and also mention a number of precise energy projects and targets that might be of practical importance for everyone who are involved in energy business with China.', '', '', 'In the early 21st century, many NOCs have undergone changes which transform themselves into International Energy Companies. The challenges which internationalization brings make NOCs pay more attention on perfecting technology Innovation systems, which promote indigenous innovation capacity and technological competitiveness in the global market. This study investigates NOC’s technology Innovation systems and extracts some key features and emphasis. A close review from two cases studies in China indicates that organization, facility, and management support are vital for the implementation of the company’s technology innovation strategy in building technology innovation systems. In the aspect of organization, NOC restructure technology Innovation organizational structures ,which optimizing allocation of R&D resources , and satisfying from R&D to commercialization in the field of explore & develop, oilfield engineering services, pipeline, refinery and chemistry. Facility is the foundation for technology innovation activities, NOCs invest on building or reequipping labs/pilots, for supporting the whole chain of innovation activities and science and technology development of national oil & gas industry. The focal points of management is on incentivizing innovativeness of R&D talent, contributing new technology /production application, and fastening open innovation. This paper describes the specific practices of two NOCs on perfecting technology innovation system and the significant results on enhancing indigenous innovation capacity and strengthening international exchanges and cooperation, which support company’s transition from technology -following to technology -leading.', '"The progress of science and technology could improve the ability of humans in the exploration and developments in the oil and gas industry. Since the 1990s, the oil and gas exploration and development, has entered the third technological revolution.

In this paper, through theoretical analysis and empirical research, the combination of qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis method, analysis of the investigation are studied. The China petroleum and natural group company and its subordinate units, more than 60 technical innovation driven enterprise developments, present situation, types, characteristics, implementation and application conditions. The empirical analysis of the domestic and foreign big companies, technological innovation driven development case, explore and sum up the effect of China petroleum technology innovation in driving the development of internal factors and external factors. Also discussed is the establishment of the ""production, study and research”, with the combination of technological innovation driven ""wheel"" model of enterprise development. Also introduced is the concept of technological innovation driven enterprise development factors.

This has driven the industry to operate at the frontiers, from the Arctic to deepwater to unconventionals. Each poses unique challenges, such as temperature, depth, pressure, remoteness, ice, geological formation, fluid type, and local environment. The industry needs to address these challenges whilst improving safety, increasing energy efficiency and driving towards a more sustainable future. Innovation takes many forms, from policy through to scientific invention, and can originate both within and outside of our industry. In terms of science, the more fundamental in nature, the more widespread its potential impact. Major waves of scientific innovation are impacting our industry today, with information technology being perhaps the most mature, such as the use of petaflop scale computing in seismic imaging, and advanced materials being perhaps the least mature, but with significant potential. That is why BP has recently committed $100m to establish the BP International Centre for Advanced Materials (ICAM), in partnership with world-leading universities. The ability to measure and manipulate matter at the molecular scale allows us to create materials that have completely different capabilities. The ICAM’s initial research will focus on structural materials, functional materials and membranes, which have enormous potential to improve integrity and cost efficiency, for example through the use of self-healing materials. The ICAM has been designed using the lessons learned from BP’s other research collaborations with universities, for example the BP Institute of Fluid Flow at Cambridge in the UK, and the Energy Biosciences Institute in California and Illinois in the USA. This model of innovation recognises the increasingly global nature of research and development, and enables the industry to move quickly to capitalise on scientific discoveries.', 'Control of nanophenomena in geological formations, field fluids and production equipment in the oil and gas industry are known as technologies of their regulation (nanotechnologies). Some ways for increasing oil-and-gas recovery are described: regulation of injected reagents ionic component, influence on the oil-and-gas layers by physical fields resulting in change of balance in system «oil-gas-water-rock», and others nanotechnologies which are used for increases in efficiency of oil-and-gas reserves operation (include gashydrate). The analysis of the nanomineral complexes geometry changes in oil formation is carried out. Our studies reveal that the control of the above nanocomlexes can increase oil recovery of oil field due to change of the capillary hysteresis value and clay minerals specific behavior at water flooding. Classification of ?OR/IOR-nanotechnologies by their effect on oil reservoirs, examples of laboratory and field test some ?OR/IOR-nanotechnologies efficiency estimations, prospects of the oil & gas nanoindustry are given.', 'Availability of exascale computing by the year 2020 will offer significant opportunities for the numerical simulation of conventional and unconventional reservoirs. In recent years, through the revolution in measurement technologies, vast amounts of static and dynamic data are being collected through the intelligent wells, intelligent fields via sophisticated sensors, and electronics. This trend is expected to continue to grow by 2020. In 2020, we will have a significant amount of data (big data) which will enable us to describe the reservoirs better and build high fidelity conventional reservoir simulator models beyond billion cells. High fidelity models of this size will help us in our quest to reach a significant increase in our ability to recover more hydrocarbons from our oil and gas fields. Through the availability of Exascale computing, it is expected that the speed of molecular simulation will increase by several orders of magnitude. By reducing run times from weeks to hours, scientists will be able to make more runs, thus better understanding how the physical and chemical interactions between the rock and fluids define how fluids flow in Nanopores. The determinates of flow in conventional reservoirs, especially in advance depletion schemes such as EOR, will be much better understood. The governing determinates of unconventional reservoirs are poorly understood and new flow equations will be required. This quest for high fidelity simulation will benefit from developments in other domains, where new discoveries in nanomaterials and chemicals using computational modeling are expected. Simulation in molecular and atomic levels via fast computing will deal with more quantum theories and will bring another dimension to reservoir simulation. It is possible that quantum computing also will enter into the picture, further increasing the speed of computations. For both conventional and unconventional reservoir simulation, 2020 will force us to rethink and reconstruct our numerical solution algorithms due to small cell sizes and molecular level computing. Advancing this domain is essential to appropriately economize the extraction of our hydrocarbon resource base.', 'Research by experts from industry and an environmental organization finds that incorporating nature into man-made infrastructure can improve business resilience – and bring additional economic, environmental and socio-political benefits. Experts from Shell, The Dow Chemical Company, Swiss Re, and Unilever, working with The Nature Conservancy, evaluated over 20 business case studies, and recommend that green infrastructure solutions should become part of the standard toolkit for modern engineers. Green infrastructure should be part of mainstream business thinking. Green infrastructure employs elements of natural systems, while traditional gray infrastructure is man-made. Examples of green infrastructure include creating oyster reefs for coastal protection, and reed beds that treat industrial waste water. The research team evaluated the assumption that green infrastructure can provide more opportunities than gray infrastructure to increase the resilience of industrial business operations against disruptive events such as mechanical failure, power interruption, raw material price increases, and floods. The evaluation concluded that hybrid approaches, utilizing a combination of green and gray infrastructure, may provide an optimum solution to a variety of shocks and improve the overall business resilience. The case studies gathered to support this research encompass a wide variety of possible applications of green infrastructure. They range from growing plants that cost-effectively remediate contaminated soil (phytoremediation), to constructing wetlands that naturally treat industrial waste water, to mitigating air pollution through innovative forest management approaches. Recurring benefits inherent to green infrastructure solutions relate to providing ecosystem services, promoting biodiversity, offering innovative approaches for engagement with local communities, while requiring less capital and less maintenance compared to gray solutions. For example, constructed wetlands can effectively remove residual hydrocarbons with significant reductions in energy consumption and green house gas emissions compared to a traditional gray waste water treatment plant. Also, the wetlands can provide habitat for fish and hundreds of species of migratory birds.', '“Big Data is the oil of the new economy” is the most famous citation during the three last years. It has even been adopted by the World Economic Forum in 2011. In fact, Big Data is like crude! It’s valuable, but if unrefined it cannot be used. It must be broken down, analyzed for it to have value. But what about Big Data generated by the Petroleum Industry and particularly its upstream segment? Upstream is no stranger to Big Data. Understanding and leveraging data in the upstream segment enables firms to remain competitive throughout planning, exploration, delineation, and field development. Oil & Gas Companies conduct advanced geophysics modeling and simulation to support operations where 2D, 3D & 4D Seismic generate significant data during exploration phases. They closely monitor the performance of their operational assets. To do this, they use tens of thousands of data-collecting sensors in subsurface wells and surface facilities to provide continuous and real-time monitoring of assets and environmental conditions. Unfortunately, this information comes in various and increasingly complex forms, making it a challenge to collect, interpret, and leverage the disparate data. Big Data technologies integrate common and disparate data sets to deliver the right information at the appropriate time to the correct decision-maker. These capabilities help firms act on large volumes of data, transforming decision-making from reactive to proactive and optimizing all phases of exploration, development and production. Furthermore, Big Data offers multiple opportunities to ensure safer, more responsible operations. Another invaluable effect of that would be shared learning. The aim of this paper is to explain how to use Big Data technologies to optimize operations. How can Big Data help experts to decision-making leading the desired outcomes?\xa0', 'This study shows the effects of technological improvement in the decrease of crude oil and gas upstream industry production cost. A common claim in the nonrenewable resource literature is that improvements in technology may largely offset the effects of increasing scarcity over time. This study provides perhaps the first empirical evidence on this issue by analyzing the determinants effect of the average finding cost for additional petroleum in oil upstream sector Iran over the period of 1968-2011. A new index of the level of world oil and gas technology is developed. Using this index and taking other determinants into account, average cost functions for gas and crude oil reserve additions, are estimated. These functions enable us to isolate the separate effects of depletion and technological improvement in the segment of oil industry. We also carry out counterfactual simulations for average finding costs in a scenario with “no technological improvement.” The analysis suggests that technological change played a major role in allaying what would otherwise have been a sharp rise in the average cost of finding crude oil reserves.', 'Development and deployment of new technologies are the most important options to deal with increasing complexity of upstream petroleum projects in a cost-effective manner. Despite the significant value added embedded in this section of the petroleum value system, there exist a general lack of awareness about the nature and role of technology therein. Some hurdles that the industry is facing in effectively developing and deploying new technologies, could be well attributed to the same lack of awareness. To address this gap, we classified upstream processes into two broad categories: Key and supporting. Criteria used to distinguish key processes from supporting ones are: (a) Expected value added from the process; (b) the complexity and number of players involved in the process; (c) the degree of sophistication of the human resources involved in the process; and (d) the knowledge content of the process. Accordingly, the upstream technologies were divided into two groups: key technologies and technological tools. Key technologies are those which have been identified as essential for data, information, knowledge and wisdom generation in the context of key processes. On the other hand, technological tools, though not absolutely essential, are those which support and enable key processes. We further analyzed these technologies with regard to their knowledge content. We believe that our findings help to narrow an important gap that has existed in our understanding of technology-based value creation in upstream petroleum industry and provide a foundation for improved management of technological innovation in this industry.', 'Controlled release technologies are widely used in pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, biocides, and other household products. In this work, we aim to apply the technologies to oilfield chemicals. We have developed a number of controlled release technologies. The technologies feature (1) nano particles with size smaller than 150 nm and (2) slow release rates for either surfactants or acids. For example, a nano-size surfactant salt particle that has a limited solubility can traverse the reservoir and deliver, over a long period of time, a constant concentration of surfactant. Petroleum sulfonate surfactant costs much less than synthetic surfactants, making it a good choice for chemical EOR. Unfortunately, sulfonates often react and precipitate with a variety of metallic cat ions; making them insoluble in sea water or high salinity water. Our research targeted turning the much undesirable metal-sulfonate precipitate into something productive. The solubility of metal-sulfonate salts ranges from soluble to sparingly soluble. By selecting proper metal cat ions for the given sulfonate, one essentially selects the sulfonate dissolution rate of the salts. This salt selection is akin to the salt selection in the pharmaceutical industry for controlled/sustained release. To date, we have developed a number of sulfonate salts nanoparticles with sizes smaller than 150 nm. Core flood tests were conducted to compare the recovery efficiency of slow release surfactant and regular surfactant solution. Preliminary results showed that slow release surfactant particle dispersion recovered ten percent more original oil in place than the regular surfactant solution. In addition, NMR imaging of the cores showed marked difference in the cores flooded by surfactant particles as well.', 'Gradually as the scale & complexity of energy industry in terms of investment, operations & impact are increasing, the impedance and risk associated with innovation is also getting bigger. Especially the energy sector cannot afford the failure rates seen in other industries (e.g. 14-15% for the IT software industry). On the other hand, innovation in the energy industry is not a choice, it’s an imperative. How will it be possible to supply a rapidly growing world population with energy in ways that are economically, environmentally and socially acceptable? This imperative is even more pressing for developing nations who are facing acute energy poverty. Globally, nearly 1.3 billion people remain without access to electricity and 2.6 billion still do not have access to clean cooking facilities. These people are mainly in either developing Asia or sub-Saharan Africa. There are likely to be major changes in energy systems. Further the speed of change is accelerating which requires companies to adjust much faster. This presents a unique dilemma & a pressing need of systemic innovation in front of both, management as well as technological experts. In this paper, an extensive literature review has been carried out on the subject. Case study methodology has been employed to understand the strategies that successful companies are employing. A holistic & multidimensional approach involving leadership development, capitalizing on intra- & entre-preneurial force, carefully designed innovation process etc. would be the keys to success. This paper chalks out a strategic roadmap to systemic innovation for oil & gas companies in India.\xa0', 'New exploration and production techniques are gaining more attention worldwide as the proved oil reserves are declining and the oil price is hiking. Although many giant oil reservoirs in the world were already depleted or facing hard problems, new technologies such as nano/bio technology are opening new windows to the solution of old problems in the matured oil reservoirs. Low sweep efficiency, costly techniques to shot off unwanted fluids production, formation damage problems, scaling in transportation and surface facilities and corrosion are the most important difficulties, petroleum engineers are facing in the oil fields. Our past experiences on using nanotechnology to the upstream cases, especially EOR processes revealed solutions to some of the challenges associated with E&P in the matured oil reservoirs. This method that utilizes particles in the order of 1 to100nm brings specific thermal, optical, electrical, rheological and interfacial properties which are directly useful to penetrate in the tiny micro-scale pores of the formation rock, coating the surface facilities, preventing fine migration, changing the interfacial and wettability states of the reservoir fluids and many other breakthrough solutions to the hurdle in the oil fields. Besides, the state of the arts analyzing techniques have been already developed in the nanotechnology such as nano computational models for multi phase flow, surface analyzing tools such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro/nano CT scanning and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are the main parts of this evolving technology. This paper summarizes new findings from several different theoretical, analytical and experimental works which shows the effectiveness of traditional methods when assisted by this new technology. Finally, based on the past experiences, a roadmap will be proposed to avoid the ongoing trial and error practice in the E&P filed.', 'Testing novel technologies, developing abandoned reservoirs and rejuvenating mature fields require top-notch technical preparation, and fit for purpose risk exposure attitude. Even in cases of the commercial availability of the right technology at the right time, studying a technological pilot and actually executing it, highly depends on the risk exposure attitude of the management which plays a crucial role. The history of Hydraulic Fracturing activity in the Congo goes up to 2007; with the background of producers with very low ornil performance and the high costs of fracking offshore for the first time in the country, the risk of investment and technological failure was elevated. At the time of the first pilot test in K-field offshore, the Eni Congo management was not so interested in the immediate gains. The management was betting on eventual success of the technology, which would start a new era for the development of low permeability reservoirs in Congo and thus making a huge impact on the future of the company production and reserves. This papers describes the lessons learnt in 5 years of frac operations in Congo with over 130 diverse frac operations (performed on different reservoir of diverse permeability ranges, green to brown fields, onshore to offshore, conventional single stage to multistage fracturing, acid and proppant frac with water base and oil base frac fluids). This paper would also serve as potential reference for all Operations Managers who are willing to optimize their assets value by means of Hydraulic Fracturing but face difficulties in winning mental barriers towards novel technologies inside or outside their companies.', '', '', 'As an industry leader in the application of cogeneration technology, also known as combined heat and power (CHP), ExxonMobil has interests in about 5,200 megawatts (MW) of cogeneration capacity established at more than 30 locations worldwide. This is enough capacity to supply electricity to over 10 million homes in Europe. With cogeneration, ExxonMobil can efficiently produce electricity to power its operations and capture heat to transform raw materials. Efficiency gains in cogeneration are significant. A typical cogeneration facility has an efficiency of 70 to 80 percent, compared to about 35 percent for a typical coal-fired power plant. In addition to improving competitiveness through energy efficiency, cogeneration also expands gas markets, increases plant reliability, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. By locating cogeneration within its facilities, ExxonMobil helps create markets for gas by generating power that typically would have been produced from coal in remote power plants. Gas-fired cogeneration emits about 70 percent less CO 2 per MWh of electricity than coal. ExxonMobil’s cogeneration investment is estimated to have reduced global CO 2 emissions by more than 6 million tonnes per year versus separate power and heat generation, equivalent to taking more than 3 million cars off the roads of Europe. Investment in a cogeneration facility is a major commitment. It takes four to six years to develop a project, costs hundreds of millions of euros to build, and the operational life may exceed 30 years. Accordingly, a long-term, stable set of rules is necessary to encourage investment in cogeneration. With the right market rules and a level playing field, the industry can and will develop attractive cogeneration opportunities.. For ExxonMobil, cogeneration has become a standard feature in many of its refining, petrochemical and production facilities, helping to reduce operating costs while improving energy efficiency and environmental performance.', 'In alignment with the State of Qatar’s environmental regulations and need for water conservation, RasGas Company Limited (RasGas) is currently studying the feasibility of creating a Treated Industrial and Process Water treatment facility. This facility will treat approximately 350 m3/hr of Treated Industrial Water and Process Water in total. These streams, which originate from all RasGas LNG trains and sales gas plants, will be treated to the standard of desalinated water, which will then be re-used within the facilities. The sources of Treated Industrial Water are sanitary water, chemical water and oily water. Treated sanitary water will be used as irrigation water for internal landscaping, whereas the remaining two sources will be sent to the new treatment facility. The sources of process water are Tail Gas Treatment units, Acid Gas Removal, Dehydration, Low Pressure flare knockout drum and boiler blow-downs. The following technologies are proposed: 1. A pre-treatment facility will be installed to treat process water to reduce H2S, Oil Content, Chemical Oxygen Demand and other parameters that will be detrimental to the biological process after the pre-treatment. 2. Membrane Bioreactor will be used to further reduce Chemical Oxygen Demand and Total Suspended Solid of Treated Industrial and Process Water. 3. Reverse Osmosis units will follow so as to reject dissolved solids of Treated Industrial and Process Water, enabling the production of freshwater of the same quality as desalinated water. 4. Brine from Reverse Osmosis units will be treated in a thermal Zero Liquid Discharge facility to recover water content in the brine stream and convert dissolved solids to salts as solid waste for easier handling and disposal. Additionally, various other concepts are being evaluated for brine disposal. This project has a number of environmental benefits as it will maximise the internal re-use of Treated Industrial Water and Process Water with no discharge to the sea or buffer zone, reducing RasGas’ freshwater imports from Ras Laffan Industrial City. Treating process water – which is currently being injected - and internally re-using it will also minimise well injection volumes.', 'The report is based on the data obtained as a result of consultancy services providing energy management systems development in accordance with the ISO50001:2011 “Energy Management System-requirements and guidance for use”. We would like to note that the standard was introduced in 2011. The report is presented by a leading specialist in EnMS development and implementation. The author’s point of view is based on international experience in diagnostic audits of EnMS, the system elements development and implementation, trainings carrying out for top managers and employees of several industrial enterprises. The report has been developed under the case study principle, considering particular difficulties which can appear while EnMS implementation. The author provides a brief insight into the history of ISO50001 development, investigates the evolution of normative regulations, which have influenced EnMS implementation practice. The major part of the report is dedicated to the analysis of practical results for problem solving, which occur before the system implementation. The author proves, basing on the practical experience, that one of the most significant problems is related to the fact that energy efficiency is not integrated to the practice of day-to-day management in the enterprises. Several years of experience in terms of EnMS implementation gives an opportunity to share the results of achieved economic effect, identify the most successful sectors and enterprises, which base their activity on systematic energy efficiency advancement. The author analyzes the drawbacks, which did not allow other companies achieve meaningful results. The experience of Russian refineries and petrochemical companies shows that it is possible to decrease annual energy consumption by 2-5%. Such energy efficiency values are quite comparable with the EU ones (2-3%). To finish the report, the author provides information about perspectives for the 50000 series of standards development, stating targets and required changes in the area of energy management.', 'Through the discovery of pre-salt a significant increase in natural gas production is expected, which contain high concentration of CO 2 - an acid gas and the major greenhouse gas. The removal of part or all of the CO 2 that the natural gas contains, is essential once one of the biggest problems of our time is the increasing CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere, believed to be causing the increase in global average temperature. CO 2 can be removed from natural gas by different gas sweetening processes, such as, chemical absorption with ethanolamines – MEA, MDEA or mixture, physical absorption with propylene carbonate, membrane permeation or by hybrid processes combining two or more processes. Whereas membranes have the advantage of being compact, occupying less space when compared to the absorption and regeneration columns involved in the chemical absorption, it has the disadvantage of being a more expensive alternative. The study of new technologies and improvement of existing ones is stimulated by the several difficulties offshore applications present, such as size of the equipments, high cost of compression and transport of the substances. This work assesses technically-economically-environmentally a technological alternative route of CO 2 capture, a hybrid process which combines chemical absorption and membrane, for Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) to Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) by CO 2 injection, which aims to increase oil production in order to generate income and, simultaneously, mitigate the emission of CO 2 . Process design, energy consumption and impact emissions were assessed and showed that this alternative exhibits higher profitability and sustainability indexes than the conventional alternatives.', 'Gas flaring reduction is a vital contribution in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency and mitigating climate change. This paper is based on a detailed study carried out on gas flaring in Kuwait Oil Company (KOC). The presentation describes the causes for gas flaring in KOC, the inherent limitations & constraints of the company, reliability analysis done on the whole gas system network in KOC, recommendations & improvements made for reducing the flaring. Based on the improvements made, KOC was able to reduce the gas flaring from 17% (in 2005) to 1.18% (in 2011) of the total gas production. This led to a gain of $ 2.75 bn for the company.', 'LNG production plant is one of the major sources of CO 2 emission, because of large energy consumption for liquefaction of natural gas and necessity of removing of all CO 2 impurity form raw feed gas. Iran LNG Company (ILC) has a project of four LNG trains, two under construction and two on schedule with total capacity of 21.6 MMTPA (million ton per annum). For the two trains under construction, ILC has made some changes on the front-end-engineering-design (FEED) as follows: –-Construction of an island power plant. –-Using electric motors as drivers for liquefaction cooling cycles. –-Deletion of 5 set of steam boilers and replacing by 5 sets of HRSG (heat recovery steam generator). The above changes shall reduce CO 2 emission from about 6.0 MMTPA to around 3.0 MMTPA for LNG production of 10.8 MMTPA . The following plan is under study for implementation to reach to about zero CO 2 emission if some financial support be available: –-Recovery of separated CO 2 from feed gas in AGRU (acid gas removal unit) and also from all HRSGs exhaust systems,incinerator and fired heaters, removing H 2 O, compressing and injecting into a nearby depleted oil or gas field. –- The recovered CO 2 may be used for production of chemicals, urea or other fertilizers. Author: Farrokh Kamali, Advisor at Iran LNG Company (ILC), Iran', 'Global warming is the most serious environmental problem people have ever met. One of the reasons for that is the focus on the mass emission of greenhouse gases. Besides emission reduction, economic and social benefits could be achieved by CO 2 flooding to enhance oil recovery. Consequently, CO 2 sequestration and recycling is among the most effective ways for emission reduction of greenhouse gas. Funded by the Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (973 Programs), fundamental researches on CO 2 capture, sequestration and flooding are processed upon a nation-wide situation of CO 2 emission and reservoir geologic features. Furthermore, theoretical and technological innovations on referred areas--such as CO 2 emission reduction and recycling – have guaranteed the technologies employed successfully in the pilot field, which simultaneously brought social benefits on emission reduction as well as economic benefits on efficient utilization. As the first pilot site of CO 2 emission mitigation and recycling as resource, the Black No.59 block in Jilin oil field has made a big breakthrough. The actual production shows that the oil production of central well is 1.9 times more than before, and the oil recovery ratio is estimated to increase by more than 13% compared with water flooding. The storage volume of CO 2 is more than 300 thousand tons. The result promotes the development of CO 2 miscible flooding in extra low-permeability reservoirs.', 'As potential CO 2 geological storage sites of Carbon dioxide Capture & Storage (CCS), the use of depleted oil-gas reservoirs and aquifers have been proposed. The long-term aim of this research is to establish a biotechnological system to convert geologically-stored CO 2 into methane, an energy resource. To develop a means for the conversion, we focus on technological application of a bio-electrochemical system using microbially-catalyzed electrode (biocathode). On the biocathode surface, methanogenic microorganisms utilize electrons to convert CO 2 (CO 2 + 8H + + 8e - ? CH 4 + 2H 2 O). Such an “electromethanogenic” system is an attractive option for energy conversion, as the biocathode yields methane from electrical current, which can be provided by renewable energy sources. In other words, intermittent electrical energy provided by, for instance, wind turbines and solar cells can be stored in a stable energy form, methane. Toward technological application of the electromethanogenic system, we examined electromethanogenic activity of subsurface microorganisms. Indigenous microorganisms originated from a domestic oil reservoir were inoculated into bio-electrochemical reactor cells. Upon application of constant voltage of -0.75 V, the reactors produced methane at a rate of 386 mmol day -1 m -2 (cathode surface area), which was the highest electromethanogenic production rate so far documented. Moreover, current-to-methane conversion efficiency was as high as 98%. Thus, we concluded that microorganisms indigenous to the subsurface reservoir are highly capable of electromethanogenic conversion of CO 2 . Electrochemical and microbial analyses suggested a reaction mechanism, in which electron-releasing bacteria mediated electron transfer from the electrode to methanogenic archaea. These outcomes imply the possibility of electromethanogenesis in underground CO 2 storage reservoirs. For further enhancement of the electromethanogenic activity, we are currently on the way to biotechnologically improving electromethanogenic biocatalysts as well as to optimizing configuration of the reactor system for subsurface reservoirs.', 'The increase of greenhouse gas concentration is one of the most concerning issues in the world. Carbon dioxide concentration has been ascending significantly in the recent fifty years. It forms the most percent of emitted greenhouse gas. Hydrocarbon reservoirs have proper conditions to dispose of carbon dioxide, because of impermeable cap rock. In addition, due to oil high demand in the world, injection of carbon dioxide is beneficial to enhance oil recovery and manage the reservoir purposefully. Hence, applying an efficient method in order to simultaneous optimization of carbon dioxide storage and oil production is essential. Lack of suitable optimization techniques in the past make most multi-objective optimization problems to be figured out as a single objective optimization issue. Development of multi-objective optimization algorithms strengthen making decisions and also, decrease taking risks for reservoir experts and managers. In this study, by using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) in an oil reservoir, some appropriate scenarios have been proposed based on simultaneous gas storage and enhanced oil recovery optimization. In this method, goals are not merged. On the other hand, optimization of each goal is performed separately. Consequently, planning of some optimized scenarios are presented. Advantages of this method make us amend production scenarios after optimization process, by regarding to variation of economical parameters.', 'With the increased concern towards protection of the environment, the waste water discharge norms are becoming more and more stringent. The high tide of technological advancements provides efficient methods to take up the challenge of the Effluent treatment, as well as to recycle treated effluent and to reduce the fresh water consumption. However, operational issues, such as sudden changes in crude mix, operating pH, interface control and mud wash frequency in desalter; automatic draining of crude or product tanks, uncontrolled flow of stripped sour water and operation change in LPG/KERO Merox and regeneration of spent caustic, diversion of closed Blow down to Oily waste sewer, could all, vastly impact Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) operation. Adherence to established design parameters and operating practices will not only help to reduce the quantum of waste water generated but also reduce the level of contaminants, thereby reducing the load on ETP. All operators strive to meet this objective, but factors like changes in feed and problems in equipment cannot be precluded. Operational upsets in upstream process units can adversely affect the operational efficiency of ETP. This is on account of large fluctuations in feed effluent quality especially with respect to oil, sulfides, phenols etc. Selection of appropriate technological option upstream and Downstream can mitigate these upsets to a large extent thus avoiding shock loading on ETP. Segregation of effluents and providing separate treatment is preferred, taking into consideration the refinery configuration. Few specific cases have been mentioned to show that small modifications in the upstream units help in minimization of effluent generated. This paper discuss various issues related to the key factors affecting quantity and quality of effluent generated in upstream refinery units and their impact on ETP performance.', 'One of the primary goals in the area of energy efficiency for industrial enterprises is rational energy resources consumption and energy savings, in particular - secondary energy resources recycling, including low-temperature ones. Most of oil and gas sector enterprises have secondary energy resources, like: - thermal energy of exhaust gas after process furnaces with the temperature 180÷600 ° ? ; - thermal energy of exhaust gas after gas-pumping units ~ 500 ° ? - abgas (oil refining by-product); - oil-associated gas; - thermal energy of refined products, extracted in the air cooling and water cooling units; - saturated vapor with low parameters (1÷3 bar); - Condensate with the temperature of 90÷120 ° ? . There are several innovative technologies which give an opportunity to use secondary energy resources. We present one of the examples of such technologies application for oil and gas sector enterprises ? Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and its efficiency. This technology helps to convert secondary resources energy into electrical energy with the efficiency output of 5÷21%. Efficiency output depends on the energy source temperature level. Besides, there is a possibility for additional thermal energy generation, which helps to increase total efficiency output up to 85%. All the possible variants of ORC plants application in the oil and gas sector, as well as forecasted efficiency while ORC implementation at different temperature levels of the energy source, are presented in the report. It is possible to reduce energy consumption up to 10% by ORC technology implementation in industrial enterprises.', 'Renewable energies are energies that come from naturally occurring and theoretically inexhaustible sources of energy which are continually replenished and currently provide less than 14% of total primary energy in the world. While there is hope for renewables to get higher share in energy mix during future decades, we face severe challenges and doubts regarding possibility of a ‘sustainable supply’ of energy by renewable sources. Renewable energies technologies are some of the fastest growing in the world but they are still not matured, are costly and complicated to develop. Environmental doubts come to mind when we expect renewable energies to resolve environmental concerns. Currently they do not eliminate greenhouse gas emissions and conventional air pollution, as manufacturing, transporting and operating them produce some emissions, consume water and disrupt land use and wildlife habitats. An increase in oil prices have a statistically positive impact on most renewable energy project returns but this means that the renewable energy sector is substantially more risky and dependent on oil and gas price fluctuations. Low oil prices and continual development of shale gas can speedily turn the renewable industry into quite a difficult financial position and even bankruptcy for private investors. Financial worries pursue when we observe for the first time in several years; 2012 saw a decline for global investment in renewable energy because of economic crisis as well as uncertainty over support policies in Europe and the US. Renewables still are quite reliant on government subsidies to survive. The past progress of renewable projects shows high dependency on government and private support in form of giving subsidies or exemption from tax, put on other energy sources (such as carbon tax). So here a valid question is: In case shale gas proves to be plentiful, accessible and cheap, wouldn’t it be sensible to put much more money on CCS and energy efficiency projects than renewable energies to decrease the investment risks and also to meet environmental obligations of some western countries? This article seeks to help energy policy makers in governmental agencies or private, set forth effective and practical approaches in securing energy supply, as well as preserving the environment by mobilizing their aid from low influential renewable energies toward higher yielding hydrocarbon technologies that can faster and better change the global energy portfolio into cleaner and environmentally friendly supply. We evaluate the different risks, limiting factors and concerns which are currently inherent in development of renewables and discuss possible solutions, such as more investment in CCS and energy efficiency projects (in which OPEC and other producing countries could also participate to create a new energy dialogue with consuming countries), to minimize the level of risk associated with our future energy supply and toward a sustainable management of energy market.', '', '', '', 'The global energy industry is entering a new cycle of growth spurred by increasing demand for energy. Yesterday’s talent has enabled the industry to make significant advances over the last 50 years, however as the competitive dynamics of the industry and energy strategies of oil and gas companies have changed, so too has the talent requirement. To replace reserves, international oil companies (IOCs) are exploring ever-more difficult and unconventional sources. New technologies require different competencies in current and future workforces and demand and exploration shifts to emerging markets call for an increase in local content requirements. Based on Accenture’s experiences and research this paper will focus on key issues and related strategies to address the current Human Resources challenges and opportunities. The paper will consider the future of work in the Oil and Gas Industry and how digital technologies are transforming talent, including: 1. Strategies and instructional techniques to expedite “speed to competency” that take advantage of new generation tools associated with social media and collaboration techniques 2.

The new generation entering the workforce that could fill the talent gap is a different generation. The so called generation Y, those born between the early 80s and late 90s, has different views and approaches to work. If companies want to be successful in the long-run, the new generation needs to be successfully integrated into companies and companies will have to adapt to the new generation. But what is so different about this new generation? This talk will highlight the main opportunities and challenges going forward, using firsthand experience of generation Ys working in the industry or taking their career choices now: Next to the differing attitudes and approaches, the image of the oil industry is a main challenge.', 'Purpose: This paper analyses Skill requirements of the Oil & Gas Industry in India in the coming years. Further, it takes a look at the Talent Crisis looming largely in Oil & Gas Industries in India and the measures being taken to counter the challenges arising out of a pending wave of retirements and competitive recruitment pressures from other industries. The paper also analyses Female workforce participation in the Indian Oil & Gas Industry and comparison is done with other Industries for women employees at various levels. The key issues related to women employees and mitigation strategies for the same are studied for other Industries and compared with that of Oil & Gas Industry. Research Methodology: We selected top 4-5 companies in various industries and approached the HR Team Members of the said companies with a questionnaire to identify the various practices, degree of advancement of the practices and impact achieved. Overall industry ‘Maturity Level’ and Oil & Gas Industry ‘Maturity Level’ was arrived at for Practices targeted at attracting and retaining women employees. We also assessed attractiveness of ‘Oil & Gas Industry’ amongst female students through a structured survey. Findings: With continued shortage of skill, attracting women employees to this industry is a business imperative. Economic success and competitive advantage may depend on attracting and retaining women employees. Certain other Industries have achieved a significant edge over Oil & Gas Industry in terms of attracting and retaining women employees. The Oil & Gas Industry needs to work on ‘Improving its Brand Perception’ and implementing practices to facilitate women employees in achieving ‘Work-life Balance’. The paper gives a detailed view on areas of improvement for Oil & Gas Companies in India to be able to attract & retain women employees in this era of ‘War for Talent’.', 'By 2020, Africa’s oil and gas production is expected to rise from 12.2 MMboed to 17.5 MMboed. However, following recent discoveries, such as the giant gas fields off the east coast, governments are under renewed pressure to prevent a resurgence of the resource-curse phenomenon. They must ensure that oil and gas developments create domestic jobs and boost the economies of these petroleum-rich countries. SBC research indicates that, when the industry’s entire supply chain is taken into account, the potential for job creation in Africa is much greater than generally thought. By 2020, the continent’s oil and gas industry could account for 2.9 million jobs, including those created by oil and gas companies (direct jobs), those created by the broader supply chain (indirect jobs) and those created by economic activities induced by the spending of oil and gas workers (induced jobs). In order to maximize the benefits to local economies of oil and gas developments, governments and local authorities must identify activities likely to generate the highest number of jobs along the supply chain and determine the most efficient ways of supporting those activities. However, the supply of adequate numbers of qualified oil and gas industry workers presents a bigger problem. For now, educational institutions lack the capacity to meet the oil and gas industry’s labor needs. For example, the industry will need to train more than 1,600 Petrotechnical Professionals per year between now and 2020, to provide the manpower required for expected growth in production. This article identifies where the biggest potential for job creation lies. It also identifies the activities that require support from local-content policies and examines how these policies should work. It concludes by determining the measures required to make the continent’s education systems capable of fulfilling industry needs.', 'In a quest to retain knowledge within their organizations, today’s O&G companies employ training programs to equip their experienced personnel with skills that can be utilized to effectively handle challenging projects. Saudi Aramco has also developed an all-encompassing training program for experienced professionals, which upon completion will allow the individual to perform duties as a subject matter expert (SME) in production engineering related job skills. This accelerated Production Engineering Specialist Program (PESP) is designed to make the transition from a young professional to an expert in a specific subject with a customized approach to his background and tailored to his future career path. PESP is applicable to young engineers after attaining five years of post-university experience, exposing them to various facets of production engineering and focusing on an explicit Specialty. The Program encompasses seven (7) specialties, all related to Production Engineering. These specialties are Stimulation, Well completion, Electrical Submersible Pumps, Well Intervention, Well Treatments, Production Optimization and I-Field. Completion of the Program is not time-based but rather mandated by completing predetermined tasks in all aspects of the respective specialty and customized to the participant’s background. The program has yielded several graduates since its inception. It is a proven successful program which has allowed PESP graduates to move around the company in assignments, targeted to provide support expertise in their related specialty in challenging situations. The paper will provide details of the PESP structure, typical Individual Development Plans (IDP) for these seven specialties and how PESP graduates can help the company to meet the technical challenges for upcoming mega-projects by utilizing their expert knowledge as SME’s. PESP has a broader scope to build an interchangeable pool of SME’s that can minimize the need and dependence of acquiring knowledge from service companies and in addition be able to train future generations of young professionals.', 'Every long term energy forecast usually tries to predict energy scenarios in 20-40 and more years, at a time when today’s young experts in the energy sector will assume the authority. Thus, nowadays students and young energy professionals throughout the world should consider what the energy sector will be like in 20 years, what sources of energy will be used in the future and what should be done today to achieve their goals. In an effort to identity and encourage the next generation of energy leaders, the World Energy Council (WEC, founded in 1923) features a special Future Energy Leaders’ Programme at the triennial World Energy Congress. The selected young delegates aged between 25 and 33 can participate in the special expert roundtables, peers discussions and prepare the FEL statement at the end of the Congress that contains the specific recommendations on energy-related issues.

Therefore the multiculturalism has become a current phenomenon that needs particular care to improve the multicultural project team effectiveness within an organization. The aim of this report is to undertake a secondary research on the integration of Multicultural Project Teams (MPTs) in oil and gas companies. The methodology followed was qualitative research through the writing documentary data collection taking our large company Sonatrach as single case study. There were two major findings. First, are the main factors that affect the MPT effectiveness which, are perception and awareness of the cultural diversity among team members, transfer knowledge, effective communication and language. Second finding are strategies to be used to reach an integrated MPT. Four strategies have been proposed: adaptation, structural intervention, managerial intervention, Exit. These strategies have an integrated relation with the main factors that affect the management of MPT, in which the strategies come to deal with the principal factors that affect these teams, being cultural diversity awareness and communication effectiveness. Moreover, it has been found that the team leader is the main element that affects the implementation of those strategies in the real world. This report will be an article that helps project managers to manage their teams in multicultural environments, as well as guiding students who will undertake studies in this area in the future, such as conducting primary research on this topic.', 'This study considers how to design a corporate social media page for recruitment purposes to attract Gen Y. The younger population who were born between 1981 and 1994 (age 18 – 32) that covers 82 million people are considered as Generation Y. Generation Y is the first generation that is acquainted with technology, especially online surfing, in their childhood. Social media has changed how people communicate with each other forever and members of Gen Y quickly and easily adapted their selves to new phenomenon. Gen Y constitutes the significant amount of social media users and it&#39;s not so hard to guess Gen Y uses social media to find jobs and search companies. It is proven that the power of social media in terms of influencing and connecting among Gen Y is incredible and social media is the one of the most important weapons that can be put to account by companies in order to reach young talents. In this respect it is better that companies should get involved in social media as quickly and smartly as possible. The talent war between the oil companies occurs around the Gen Y and the companies require new strategies to attract Gen Y rather than conventional ways. Social media has a significant potential in recruitment process and it might be a key not only for active job seekers but also for youngsters interested in the oil and gas industry. Visual appearance of social media page is a leading factor that attracts Gen Y’s attention. The studies prove that social media users affirm that “ if it looks pleasant, I just trust it ”. This study will discuss the 4 main characteristics of designing social media pages that might increase the attention of Gen Y in recruitment process. 1. Corporate message 2. Attractive visuals 3.

Also it tries to identify different layers of indirect workforce and their modes of engagement in Downstream Oil Companies. We have also attempted to understand what are the “Responsible Behaviours” expected out of these people in the Business & Sustainability context. We have also attempted to understand the various initiatives being taken up by Downstream Oil Companies in India in developing those set of responsible behaviors amongst the indirect workforce to maintain a competitive advantage and a sustainable value. From our study we find that primary “Responsible Behaviours” expected out of indirect workforce are “Safety Consciousness”, “Customer Centric Behaviour” and “Ethics”. Out of these, safety definitely merits special mention, owing to the nature of operations in the Oil & Gas Industry. Safety of employees and the neighbouring communities is one of highest priorities for Oil & Gas Industries. In terms of indirect workforce, it was found that Safety remains a major area of concern especially for people engaged in transport of Oil Products (PCVO crew) from one location to another as they generally on the go. Also we conducted survey of PCVO crew members under different transporters to understand their orientation towards “Responsible Behaviour” expected out of them and we found that there is lack of structured impetus in this area. The paper further delves into BPCL case of study on how PCVO crews were oriented to practise the above-mentioned “Responsible Behaviours” especially “Safety Consciousness”. Systematic engagement with PCVO crew brought a sea-change in their mindset and encouraged them to conduct themselves responsibly.', '"Unique opportunities for the development of intellectual potential exists in the universities with academic teaching schools.

This presentation will draw on the findings of this UN initiative, developed in association with Accenture, which outlines priority actions oil and gas companies can take to become more energy efficient, to advance business opportunities in the sustainable energy market – and to improve energy access and affordability. Recommendations: • Use more renewable energy sources and emphasize energy efficiency throughout the entire fuels supply chain. • Reduce the flaring of gas from operations and identify opportunities to reuse captured gas on-site or provide energy to local communities. • Invest in research and development and utilize core competencies to bridge the gap from fundamental research to commercialization of liquid renewable transportation fuels and renewable generation technologies. • Promote international trade in sustainable energy products. • Use innovative business models and create new products and services to improve energy affordability and to enable access to clean cooking and heating solutions. Resources companies are an important partner when it comes to investment and financing, capability and capacity development, and long-term strategic planning – all critical to helping address energy poverty.', 'The Oil & Gas Industry today touches lives in various forms; whether it is through reducing time-horizons by energizing our vehicles or through paints which add colours to our lives. Today’s life is impossible without the Oil & Gas Industry! Interestingly, it’s also one of the most unpopular industries! Although Oil & Gas companies widely proclaim their primary mission as “Energizing Lives of People”, still a large chunk of the population continues to reel under “Energy Poverty”. This disconnect with society is more evident in developing countries. Globally, nearly 1.3 billion people remain without access to electricity and 2.6 billion still do not have access to clean cooking facilities. These people are mainly in either developing Asia or sub-Saharan Africa. There is tremendous energy that Oil & Gas Companies can unleash for “Energy-Poor” populations through integrating their CSR strategies with their Mission. The CSR programs of Oil & Gas companies in India are centred on classical strategies of doing social good and realizing Government mandate of investment in CSR. The recent economic turmoil coupled with increasing emphasis on inclusive & conscious capitalism around the world have fueled a rigorous re-thinking on the underlying principles of Business. Even the purpose & understanding of CSR is changing. Business Gurus like C.K. Prahlad & Michael Porter have emphasized paradigm shift and idea of co-creating social value especially at the bottom of the pyramid. This paper analyses the CSR strategies of Oil majors in India in the light of recent advancements in business understanding. We explore how Oil & Gas companies in India can take the lead & involve various stakeholders to enable ‘Energy access to all’ and co-creating business & social value simultaneously. Our paper chalks out a holistic strategic roadmap to facilitate metamorphosis of an unpopular industry to a heroic saviour.', 'Mexico has taken the first steps to modernize its oil industry that has been in decay for the last few years. The Energetic Reform can booster economic growth; but first, enhance by far resource-constrained poverty abatement policies. The country suffers from a great income disparity that hides at plain sight, the huge relative amounts of people living in multidimensional and extreme poverty, the highest in the OECD. Developing deep and ultra-deep oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico thanks to joint venture with foreign oil companies is likely to booster oil output and government spending up to 30% by 2015. Three scenarios are built considering: prospective new fields in the Gulf and their possible outputs; the specs of secondary regulation; the previous outcomes of energy poverty alleviation programs and the overall effects on GDP in a partial IGG equilibrium model. When addressing energy poverty abatement, extracting oil today instead of leaving it for ´the future´ has special theoretical treatment due not only to ethical ground of intragenerational over intergenerational justice but in terms of economic efficiency and technological push. Overall, the new Reforms in Mexico, with an adequate regulation, can easily provide the state with the extra revenues necessary to abate energy poverty in 50% by the end of 2015 by Millennium Development Goals standards, and by 2035 eradicate energy and extreme poverty by fostering an inclusive green growth. This growth model based on Oil production would likely lead to higher economic development with energy, income and environmental security prioritizing intragenerational justice in the allocation of resources. Future research could be developed for other countries with similar multidimensional energy poverty issues, which lack technical and financial capabilities to optimally develop their oil resources.\xa0', 'Switching CSR outflow from ‘commitment levels’ to ‘spending levels’, thanks to recent Guideline of Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) in India, has provided necessary thrust to CSR programs of 7 major organizations in Indian Hydrocarbon Industry with spending of $ 385 Million on CSR activities since 2007-08 with average allocation of 1.63% of their Profit After Tax in 2011-12 and 5 year CAGR growth of 14%. Authors noted that in an energy deficient economy like India where 57% of Rural and 28% of Urban population is energy poor with No/Limited access to energy and in view of economic slowdown, the role of Corporate CSR projects directed towards reducing energy poverty will be crucial. Authors noted that ‘Reducing Energy Poverty’ is swiftly emerging as an integral part of corporate CSR strategy of Hydrocarbon Industry in India to ensure that energy deprived class leap-frogs the fossil fuel trajectory of growth. Authors analyzed CSR guidelines of DPE and CSR projects of 7 major organizations under the aegis of Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoP&NG) and categorized these projects under 5 diverse thrust areas of Drinking Water/Sanitation, Health/Medical Care, Education/Literacy Enhancement, Skill Development/Empowerment and Energy. Authors prepared a CSR Participation matrix (CSR-PM) and studied the CSR projects directed towards ‘Eradicating Energy Poverty’ and noted that projects undertaken towards this endeavor are gradually picking up pace as all the 7 organizations have included energy poverty as integral part of their CSR policy. Authors identified the best CSR practices in terms of cost effectiveness and community engagement in these projects and suggest lessons for global hydrocarbon industry. Authors further suggest that re-balancing of CSR portfolio by organizations across the hydrocarbon value chain in-line with domestic renewable energy policies will be crucial for reducing energy poverty across the globe and ensuring universal energy access to all by 2030.', 'How could energy poverty be confronted? Tackling energy poverty is an increasingly acknowledged global challenge in order to improve quality of life and a key imperative for economic development. Peru has recognized a close relationship between energy and economic growth. In the last Energy Architecture Perfomance Index (EAPI) 2013, Peru achieved the 15th place in regard to 105 countries. Moreover, concerning the specific objective “Economic growth and development”, Peru heads up the ranking. This result is due to having an economic growth and low inflation as well as a largely improvement in energy intensity throughout policies that has reformed the energy market and taken advantage of natural resource endowments to drive sustainable economic development. Nevertheless, Peru still shows deficiencies with respect to coverage of modern energy, mainly in rural areas of the country, a common issue for the countries in this part of the world. For this reason, Peru, throughout government’s policy package, looks for confronting energy poverty level, achieving significant results. In this context, the proposed paper will examine the suite of more specific policy interventions that have been developed to tackle energy poverty in Peru. Among the set of actions that the government, together with industry and civil society, has been promoting, it could be mentioned the “Rural Electrification National Plan”, the “Household Photovoltaic Electrification National Programme”, “Stove Peru” national programme, “Natural Gas Massification National Programme”, “Energy Social Inclusion Fund” and “Fuel Price Stabilization Fund”. This is a suite of strategic tools that help the understanding of different pathways to the future and filling the gap of inequality between the cities and isolated rural areas. Finally, the paper will conclude that energy poverty is a major social problem causing considerable hardship and negative impacts over economic growth and development; consequently, it is vital to tackle it, throughout adequate government policies.', 'The Indian rural sector uses traditional fuels such as wood and dung cakes which release hazardous chemicals including hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and sulphur oxides. With cooking spaces often poorly ventilated, exposure to these fumes heightens the risk of respiratory diseases. These traditional fuels also pose a number of disadvantages, burning inefficiently and in a manner that is difficult to control. Collection of traditional fuel is also arduous and time-consuming, with the average villager spending a significant portion of time and income in securing daily energy requirements. The modern cooking fuel of LPG represents a welcome alternative to traditional fuels but, however, is still not yet affordable by the poor. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), India has initiated a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative called ‘Rasoi Ghar’ which is a community kitchen shared by several households of one village. The concept is to make cleaner fuel accessible to rural communities and give them better health, hygiene and safety. Centrally located in a village, the Rasoi Ghar is a ready kitchen set up in a well-constructed house, allowing several villagers to cook their daily meals at a time. Each Rasoi Ghar is equipped with an adequate water supply, cooking slab, basic cooking utensils and a minimum number of stoves connected to replaceable LPG cylinders. Recently, HPCL has constructed Rasoi Ghar kitchen with an adequate number of LPG stoves in a north east Bangalore village named Tarabahalli. To improve the cooking efficiency, the community kitchen was provided with utensils. Also pressure cookers were distributed to every family in the village. This CSR initiative of Rasoi Ghar was widely appreciated by rural folks at Tarabahalli village which has helped the poor families in the village to use clean, safe and efficient fuel for cooking and thus enabling them better health and focus on improvement of their daily livelihoods.', 'Latest oil and gas technologies, high oil prices and global climate change make the international business community and oil & gas companies explore distant hard accessible regions such as the Arctic [1] , which is characterized by huge hydrocarbon resource potential [2] , and can help our society to find a solution for escalating demand for energy. The importance of Arctic petroleum resources goes beyond the regional and national economies. Many consider the Arctic to be the last large petroleum frontier outside the OPEC cartel. [3] Thus geopolitical status of the Arctic is the subject for international game. The paper gives deeper insight into the interconnected and globalized topic of petroleum developments in the Arctic region, provides better understanding of up-to-date trends, politics and international relations through the prospect of economic opportunity, which is the strongest driver for the new attention that the Arctic is receiving [4] , especially in the presence of economic and strategic interests, opening of areas by governments for industry exploration and public engagement. A complex series of steps and guidelines is suggested for peaceful, mutually advantageous and successful cooperation of the actors in the Arctic region in the nearest future, because the challenges will be even higher.

More than 40,000 units of residential fuel cells have been sold up to 2012 and fuel cell vehicles (FCV) will be thrown in the market from 2015 in Japan. However, hydrogen energy has not been able to be stored or transported in a large-scale in the world. “Storage and transportation” technology is necessary for hydrogen energy to be utilized globally as a general energy as same as fossil energy. Chiyoda has succeeded to develop a new process “SPERA” to store and transport hydrogen energy in a large-scale by using Organic Chemical Hydride (OCH) method. In this method, hydrogen is fixed to toluene through the chemical reaction and converted to methylcyclohexane (MCH). Toluene and MCH are in the liquid state under the ambient temperature and pressure since both are the components of gasoline. Toluene and MCH can be stored in conventional tanks and transported by conventional chemical tankers. The chemical tanker which is of the middle range class (50,000 tons ship) can transport 44,000 tons of MCH including 2,700 tons of hydrogen which amount is for s total fueling number of 540,000 FCVs. “SPERA” process has been completed to develop through the demonstration test with high and stable performance by the pilot plant constructed in Yokohama, Japan in 2013. Why Hydrogen? We are facing to the global warming issue by CO 2 emission in this century, and the limitation issue of the fossil resources in the future century. Hydrogen can transport the any primary energy including renewable energy as a clean energy carrier. “SPERA” process opens the door to low carbon society, and hydrogen is the new article of energy commerce. It has the potential for the game changing in the energy business.', 'This paper works on Future Studies methodology for empowering Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This study area has several significant parameters for Energy & Environmental Future Studies program, of local and regional importance. It is noticeable that South Pars Gas Field is the biggest Iran Gas Field and Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) & PSEZ are the biggest producers of the petrochemical industry. PSEEZ & PSEZ set the RE policy in the region. The leadership of PSEEZ & PSEZ made a strategic decision to establish a Renewable Energy Sector in the country. In this paper we use Futures Studies Methodologies (Foresight, Backcast, Scenario Planning, Trend Analysis, and Strategic Foresight). We hope to achieve: understanding applied Foresight in strategy, improvement in pragmatic Foresight, expanding Foresight processes to applied feature knowledge. We suggest a strategic Foresight view in PSEEZ in the Petrochemical Industry section to achieve this goal. It should be mentioned that the scope of CSR is categorized into three areas; social obligation, social reaction and social response. We focus on the last category, being social response. The paper is structured in the following manner. First, the literatures on CSR & Future Studies methods were reviewed. Second, the Future Studies methods (Foresight, Backcast , Scenario Planning, and Trend Analysis, Strategic Foresight) of energy saving & energy Consumption & environmental solution in more than 20 petrochemical plants are introduced. Third, the paper discusses the different business units of PSEEZ & PSEZ and their related projects and investments at local and regional levels. Finally, the role of CSR and department of RE and future studies in mentioned issues in this zone to achieve a Path to Sustainable Energy Future are highlighted. The case study demonstrates the willingness of oil & gas & petrochemical-producing countries to become more sustainable.', 'Nowadays, all renewable energies have an important role in contributing to energy systems in the world. These resources promise the possibility of replacing fossil sources. Renewable energies are basically compatible with nature and they don’t pollute and because they are renewable there is no end for them. The last decades experiences show that, according to increasing levels of energy consumption in the world, and limited reservoirs of fossil fuels they can at least provide the world energy needs for 100 years. But the deep challenges facing the world energy system will be environmental issues. On the other hand, Iran’s economy has depended on income from selling mentioned resources through exporting oil and gas. It is obvious that these sources will end and at the same time environmental issues become important, so disconnection of this dependency is essential and we should look for replacements of oil and gas. In this scientific project, first, the importance of considering renewable energies and their different types, like solar energy and wind energy and biomass energy, geothermal energy and sea energy etc have been investigated and then their functions like economical cases, environmental cases and etc are explained. Costs needed to use these energies in some parts of Iran are evaluated.', '"Methodology: This paper describes the methodology followed to build three exploratory scenarios looking out to 2050 and develops them in the form of narrative storylines. The stories are fleshed out around a set of key drivers considered as the areas in which the most relevant uncertainties for the energy/environment system can be found. As a result three different images of the world are given and, consistent with those images, implications are suggested for the energy technologies that are likely to emerge in each of those worlds. Purpose: The purpose of this work is to explore possible energy futures for energy and the environment over the coming 50 years. Although the perspective adopted is that of an organization of industrialized countries, the scope of the analysis must clearly be global. The aim of the mentioned scenarios is to stimulate discussion about environmental sustainability of our energy system, security of supply, and energy technology development. The Paper is structured in the following manner. 1) We talk about background & methodology of scenarios. 2) Common Features of the Three Scenarios, Elements that Differentiate the Scenarios are highlighted. 3) Scenario 1 ""Clean, but not sparkling"" is analyzed. 4) Scenario 2 ""Dynamic but Careless"" is mentioned. 5) Scenario 3 ""Bright Skies"" is analyzed. 6) Comments and Implications of the Three Exploratory Scenarios are provided. 7) Implications for Policy & for Technology are developed . It should be mentioned that for each scenario the report of Developed Countries & Developing Countries are introduced."', 'Purpose: Since independence, Public sector enterprises in India, including oil companies, have been directing their efforts towards the goal of Nation Building. Oil & Gas Companies aimed to acquire energy security for the nation, with clearly defined pavilions of operation -Upstream, Midstream and Downstream. However, India’s ever present (and constantly growing) energy gap and precarious economic & crude price scenario necessitated them to re-visualize themselves as players in ‘Energy Arena’ and re-orient their strategies towards ‘Building Sustainable & Energised Future’ for themselves as well as for the Nation. With this realization Oil & Gas Companies transcended their boundaries and forayed into ‘Energy Value Chain” and also adopted a “Beyond Oil” approach. Through this paper, we explored to what extent, the Oil & Gas companies are on-track towards “Building Sustainable Future” and truly “Energized India”. Research Methodolgy: We did extensive literature review and employed interview methodology to understand the Strategies of Oil & Gas Companies and their investments (in areas like R&D, Cap-ex, Capability Building etc.) in the “Energy Arena”. An in-depth study of Integrated Energy Policy by Government of India has been done to gauge the “Energy Requirements” and connected Policy dimensions have been elucidated in our Paper. Findings: Oil & Gas Companies have initiated steps towards becoming “Integrated Energy Companies”. Partnerships are being explored to leverage the synergies and significant strides have been made in certain areas. However, scale and speed, especially in the area of ‘Beyond Oil’ and dependency on ‘Imported Oil’ is still a major concern. Our Paper covers in-depth the analysis and comparison of Strategies of Oil & Gas Companies in India as well as major foreign players and ascertains whether their aspirations are realistic visions or mere delusions.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Fossil fuels have \xa0begun to dominate the global energy mix after the share of coal passed that of wood about one and a half century ago.

The historical development of oil and gas production/consumption patterns as well as of ownership of oil and gas reserves provide sufficient information to understand the major geopolitical factors affecting the present-day transition. Other geopolitical factors, which can impact many areas of petroleum industry, would be the competition of IOC/NOC on reserve capital and production, structural changes in state-own petroleum companies, development of clean coal technologies and reborn of coal, vast investment requirements of petroleum producers, supply and demand balance especially in the developing world, increasing oil prices and game-changer alternatives such as oil and gas shale, heavy oil, gas hydrates, coal-bed methane, etc., recent developments in renewable energy industry especially in Europe and finally global climate change.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''];
